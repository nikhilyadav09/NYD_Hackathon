Chapter,Verse, Explanation
1,1,"The word ""atha"" is used in two ways in Vedic scriptures. Firstly, it is used as an invitation to initiate the ritual or ceremony, and secondly, it is used to indicate that the previous processes or preparations have been completed. When a seeker has completed the necessary preparations or has developed the required mindset, Maharshi Patanjali says, ""Then"" (atha), ""Now"" (ab) is the time to start the Yoga discipline.

In everyday language, when we say ""ab"", it means ""until now"" or ""till now"", implying that something has happened or is already done. For instance, ""I have made a mistake, now I won't do it again"".

Similarly, in the context of Yoga, if one has completed the necessary preparations or has developed the required mindset, Maharshi Patanjali says, ""Now"" (ab) is the time to start the Yoga discipline.

Just like one needs to meet the necessary qualifications to enter a university, one needs to meet the necessary yogic qualifications to enter the discipline of Yoga. When one is no longer satisfied with external and worldly solutions, when one's mind is eager to enter the kingdom within, when one is aware of their defects and longs to completely eradicate them, when one desires to be free from all vices, then the time comes to enter the discipline of Yoga.

When one's mind is filled with such feelings and sentiments, Maharshi Patanjali says, ""Now"" (ab) is the time to start the Yoga discipline. Those who have developed such feelings and sentiments in their lives can start the Yoga discipline."
1,2,"Yoga is the cessation of the modifications of the mind. In ancient times, the tradition of guru-shishya parampara was prevalent, where the guru taught the shishya (student) philosophy through the study of scriptures. Before the study of scriptures, the student was provided with initial education to understand the subject matter. The study was conducted through a dialogue between the guru and shishya, where the student would ask questions and the guru would provide answers. In this way, a harmony was maintained throughout the learning process.

The first aphorism of yoga philosophy is ""Athayoganushasanan."" As soon as we read this, a spontaneous inquiry arises: What is yoga? This inquiry is natural, and Maharshi Patanjali, while defining yoga, explains to his students: Cessation of the modifications of the mind is yoga. This is a comprehensive, concise, and profound definition of yoga. To understand yoga in its entirety, it is necessary to understand what the mind is, what its modifications are, and what does the word ""niruddha"" mean.

The mind is a vast terrain where thoughts arise, grow, and take root in the form of habits. The mind is a kind of ground where thoughts arise, and it has five types: kshipta, vikshipta, mudha, ekagra, and niruddha. Here's an important point: yoga is possible only when the mind reaches a state of ekagra and niruddha.

Now, let's discuss the concept of vritti. Vritti is not a singular concept, but a plural one, meaning that it is not one, but multiple. We will discuss the various aspects of vritti further. The word ""niruddha"" means to stop the waves of thought; it is not just a matter of suppressing the mind.

In Sanskrit, the importance of prefixes and suffixes is immense, as they can change the meaning of a word completely. Maharshi Patanjali was not only the author of yoga philosophy but also a great grammarian. If he had used the prefix ""ni"" with the root ""rudh,"" it would not have been futile. When one tries to stop the modifications of the mind, yoga is still not complete.

Many have interpreted ""niruddha"" as restraining the mind, meaning ceasing the modifications of the mind. However, if the attempt to restrain"
1,3,"one must feel oneself as separate to behold one's purest form, to know oneself. This is the first and most important step towards self-knowledge. As soon as we become the Seer, the visible world becomes different from us; we can then practice the use of discrimination to establish ourselves in our true Form. The second word is Form. There are three states in this world: Jiva, Prakriti, and Purush, each having its own Form, which we must know to achieve the purpose of our existence. Samkhya philosophy discusses the Form of the Jiva. Asangoham purusha ity (1.15): this Jiva is formless. The individual who sees remains unaffected by what he sees, and is therefore called Asang. 

In the same way, the lotus flower remains unaffected by its association with water or mud. Samkhya Darshan's first chapter, verse 19, declares the Jiva to be forever pure, forever aware, and forever free. Maharshi has expressed the same pure, aware, and free nature of the Jiva through the word Form in this sutra. When one is established in yoga, one achieves one's Form."
1,4,"When the tendencies of the mind are not controlled, the jiva-atma behaves according to the tendencies of the mind, just as the tendencies are. It perceives, listens, understands, and experiences accordingly. The tendencies also lead to worldly attachment and bring momentary happiness. There are three initial stages of the mind - kshipt, muudh, and vikshipt - which turn the seeker towards the world. The question arises that when the seeker is not in the state of niruddha but is in one of the three states, why does the jiva-atma adopt tendencies similar to the mind? The reason is that the senses are naturally outward-going and all the states except niruddha and ekagra lead the tendencies outward. The jiva-atma can experience only through the medium of external senses and therefore adopts the tendency of the mind. Since the first three stages enable one to gain knowledge of the world and their movement is opposite to that of niruddha and ekagra, they always lead towards the world, never towards the self. Yoga begins with the state of ekagrata and culminates in the state of niruddha, simultaneously establishing the true self. It is not that the jiva-atma becomes the tendency, but rather it is manifested like a gemstone being coloured by a dye. Just as a gemstone becomes the same colour as the dye, the jiva-atma also becomes like the tendency it is associated with, whether in the external world or in the world of attachment."
1,5,"""Patanjali, the seer, has described the yogic perspective on mental faculties or vrittis in the second sutra of the Samadhipada. However, there are two more aspects to these vrittis, namely the subtle and the gross, which are five in number, and each of these five vrittis has both subtle and gross aspects. Therefore, it is essential to understand the subtle and gross nature of these vrittis. The entire science of yoga is based on the control of vrittis, and hence, it is crucial to understand them clearly. Until we understand the nature of the problem, we cannot find its solution or remedy. Therefore, let us try to understand the subtle vrittis, which are those that generate the five kleshas (avidya, asmita, raga, dvesha, and abhinivesha) and are the fertile ground for karma-generated tendencies. In short, the vrittis that cause suffering are the subtle ones, and they are subject to control. The vrittis that generate knowledge and block the influence of satva, rajas, and tamas are considered gross vrittis, also known as sattvic vrittis, which bring happiness. Both subtle and gross vrittis can arise independently, and each of them creates corresponding samskaras (impressions) in the mind, which affect human behavior. Only when the vrittis are controlled and the samskaras are purified can a person attain liberation and simultaneously enjoy the joy of life."""
1,6,"""The five mental states are of two kinds, pure and impure. The five mental states are: 1. Pramana, 2. Viprayaya, 3. Vikalpa, 4. Nidra, and 5. Smriti. Whether these five mental states are the only ones or there are more, is a question that can arise in the mind. After careful consideration, it can be understood that Maharsi has only mentioned the five fundamental mental states here. All other mental states are included in these five, and the cessation of these five impure mental states is also the cessation of all impure mental states. None of these five mental states are excessive or aberrant. Maharshi Patanjali has created the science of Yoga in a pure and scientific manner, and this is confirmed step by step in the scriptures. It is essential to understand the fundamental law of mental states. If this is not understood, the path of Yoga cannot be followed, the journey cannot begin, and the destination will not be achieved.

A mental state that directs the seeker towards their own true form and the supreme Self is pure and should be nurtured with effort. A mental state that turns the seeker away from their own true form and the supreme Self is impure and should be restrained with constant practice.

It is clear that the cessation of all the five fundamental mental states is not necessary, because until we reach the ultimate goal, we must continue our journey, and we cannot continue this journey without the help of these five fundamental mental states. We cannot advance on the path of Yoga, the path of God, without these five fundamental mental states. We will explain further how each mental state gives rise to both happiness and suffering."""
1,7,"""The three kinds of proof mentioned in Yoga Darshan are: direct, inference, and scriptural (verbal) evidence. That which provides clear knowledge of the nature and state of any object is called proof. Maharshi Patanjali first introduced the concept of proof among the five-fold pramana. These five pramana have a particular order: pratyaksha, anumana, agama, vikalpa, niddra, and smriti.

Pratyaksha refers to the direct perception of an object through the senses. This can be either pleasant or unpleasant, leading to either spiritual growth or distraction.

The question arises as to how one can distinguish between the direct senses that are pleasant and those that are unpleasant. In this world, what is perceived as pleasant and what is perceived as unpleasant can be distinguished by introspection. Pleasant sensations calm and delight the mind, leading to concentration. Unpleasant sensations, on the other hand, trouble and perturb the mind, leading to distraction.

The two kinds of direct senses are distinct in their effects on the mind. The pleasant direct senses are those that bring service to others, listening to spiritual songs, enjoying pleasant scents, and partaking of wholesome food, etc.

The unpleasant direct senses, on the other hand, are those that involve harm to others, viewing indecent scenes, listening to bad music, enjoying foul smells, and consuming unwholesome food, such as meat and intoxicants."
1,8,"The second of the five faculties is Vikara. The direct meaning of Vikara is false knowledge or wrong cognition. The Bhagavata Purana says that Vikara is not proof because it is destroyed by proof. Mithya-Jnana is an obstacle to our spiritual progress because it can deceive us and prevent us from reaching our destination. 

The true knowledge that comes through evidence or direct perception is necessary for spiritual practice and self-realization. 

Misconception is the exact opposite of true knowledge. For example, if you are walking in a dark path and see a rope and think it is a snake, it is a misconception. But if you investigate further, you will find that it is not a snake. 

This type of misconception has five types: avidya, asmita, raga, dwesha, and abhinivesha. These five types of obstacles can be understood in more detail. The direct meaning of Kaushalya is suffering. 

Yogadrishti deals with the entire topic of suffering and its causes, and ways to overcome them. This will be explained in more detail in the following sutras and pada."
1,9,"""Option is neither a proof nor a contradiction. Option is a fictional knowledge that, like experiencing knowledge through hearing, experiences a sensation, but there is no real object, person, or situation there. It is only linguistic, audible. Option is a power where anything can be created through words, but there is no real existence. This has been presented with many examples in scriptures, such as a daughter-in-law's son, the flower in the sky, the consciousness of a person, and the form of the self-existent person. In various situations, the habit of option is used for pure conduct, but sometimes it is created due to ignorance. The habit of option is both pleasant and unpleasant, bringing suffering and happiness."""
1,10,"Upon waking up, the memory of sleep is experienced, and even Rishi Patanjali has called it a vritti (mental tendency). In the Vyas Brahmya, it is asked how sleep is a special kind of knowledge? Then Vedavyasa Ji says, ""I got a good sleep, my mind is pleased and a little light, or my limbs feel heavy, darkness and restlessness are pervading my mind, my whole body is lethargic, I didn't get a good sleep at night, and such knowledge cannot be achieved without experience, that is why it is called a kind of vritti. This vritti is also subject to cultivation and purification. According to scriptures, a person's four states are waking, dreaming, deep sleep, and the fourth state. The waking state is when a person is fully awake and performs all his tasks with discrimination, with knowledge, and without any confusion. He distinguishes between good and bad and lives accordingly. The dream state is when a person is partially awake and partially asleep, and in this state, he is under the control of tendencies formed by actions and their consequences and experiences various things and sees dreams. Deep sleep is when a person is neither awake nor asleep, and in this state, the influence of tamas gun is most prevalent and there is a natural flow of satva gun, which causes a person to say goodbye to the world of the waking and sleep, 'Today, I slept peacefully.'"
1,11,"""Let us talk about the last and fifth stage of purification, which Maharshi called Smriti by name. According to Yoga Darshan, the meaning of Smriti is the recall of the experiences of the past in one's lifetime, such as having crossed the road for an elderly mother two years ago and the memory coming back today. In Yoga Darshan, this is called the last and fifth stage of purification. The authoritative commentary on Yoga Darshan by Vedavyasa is available, according to which our mind (intellect and ego) recollects both knowledge and objects. The essence of an object is inextricably linked to its knowledge, and it is this essence that explains the pure form of both the object and its knowledge. This essence then gives rise to samskara (impression), and samskara gives rise to Smriti (memory). The memories that arise in the waking state are true to the subject matter, while those that arise in the dream state are related to imaginary subjects. Such memories, which lead to pleasure, pain, and attachment, are to be abandoned. In the highest state of Yoga, Samadhi, all these memories are obstacles; therefore, the practitioner should abandon them through the natural practice of renunciation and detachment. The memories that lead to knowledge, renunciation, riches, and righteous conduct are not obstacles but aids. With time, they will naturally cease."""
1,12,"So far, we have understood the guidelines, definition, and types of yoga in detail. This sutra is one of the important sutras of Yoga Darshan. Its literal meaning is that through the practice of abstention from worldly desires and the experience of detachment, the citta (mind) can be calmed. In other words, these waves of thought can be subdued effortlessly. Here, we will try to understand the practice and detachment one by one because if these are not understood correctly, progress in yoga is impossible. I have written earlier that most people have misunderstood the definition of yoga and the ways to achieve a state of yoga. Let me put it simply - the practice means a sincere effort or the pursuit of perfection. Detachment means effortless pursuit or inner purification. Through practice, we maintain the purity of our actions and also handle our life effortlessly. Yoga is the name of complete perfection - here, both the physical body and inner life are taken care of. It is not possible to achieve progress in yoga until we are earnest and sincere, because both go hand in hand. If your body is not healthy, your entry into yoga is impossible, and if your body may appear healthy but your mind is not, a little practice may lead to a downfall, and there is a higher probability that you will refrain from practice again. Therefore, we establish ourselves in yoga through the medium of practice and detachment. This helps to suppress our complex thoughts and emotions, which cause us suffering and create turmoil in our minds. According to the commentary of Vyasa, the mind is likened to a river that flows in two directions. One branch flows for the sake of redemption and the other for the sake of sin. The branch that flows for redemption is the one that takes the seeker to the path of self-realization and is inclined towards the path of discrimination. The branch that flows towards worldly pursuits is the one that leads towards unawareness and is inclined towards the path of ignorance. Through detachment, the latter branch can be dried up, and through the practice of constant contemplation, the power of discrimination can be awakened. In this way, the thoughts and emotions of the mind can be suppressed under the control of practice and detachment."
1,13,"physical, mental, and spiritual. 

Physical strength is obtained through regular practice of yoga, physical exercise, proper sleeping and waking schedule, and observing daily routines. 

Mental strength is obtained through good thoughts, doing good deeds, and fulfilling small desires. 

Spiritual strength is obtained when a person's thoughts, words, and actions become identical, and when the ego is shed. 

When these three types of strength gradually develop in a devotee, enthusiasm also begins to manifest. 

The simultaneous manifestation of strength and enthusiasm results in the development of a natural control over the mind, intellect, senses, and consciousness. 

If a devotee has not developed these three types of strength, but has only developed enthusiasm, it will not be beneficial. 

However, when a devotee has developed all three types of strength, enthusiasm will naturally arise, and he will be able to make rapid progress in his spiritual practice. 

When a devotee feels the presence of strength and enthusiasm, he should carefully use them to propel himself forward on the path of yoga. 

If he does not know how to use them, he may encounter problems. 

Physical progress in life comes from strength and enthusiasm, and by using these same qualities in spiritual practice, one can attain spiritual progress and become detached. 

Here, practice refers to the strength and enthusiasm that arise from regular yoga practice, good food, good conduct, and good thoughts. 

If a devotee has obtained physical and mental strength through regular yoga practice and good habits, he"
1,14,"To establish a seekers' foundation in yoga, Maharsi says that a single practice cannot bring about any result. It is necessary to practice with dedication and persistence over a long period of time, with brahmacharya, faith, tapas, and vijnanapada. Only such a practice can establish a strong foundation. A seeker has both strength and enthusiasm, but sometimes he makes mistakes in yoga. Therefore, it is necessary to practice with persistence and dedication over a long period of time.

We often see that people give up after making some effort and then regret it. Many young people come to me and say that they try to practice brahmacharya, but soon some samskaras arise suddenly and their energy is destroyed in the storm. Then, they feel guilty and their entire mind becomes polluted.

This is because the foundation of their practices was weak. If we practice with shraddha, tapas, vijnanapada, and brahmacharya, we can remain stable even in the face of samskaras. The youth should understand that they need to strengthen their foundation, even if they fall several times. They should learn to balance and collect themselves to achieve their goal.

In the sutra, there is a beautiful word - satkarma. When a guest comes to your home, you welcome them with satkarma. You show them respect by asking them to sit comfortably, offering them good food and drink, and ensuring they have a restful stay. You would even borrow resources from a neighbor if needed.

If your mind does not find joy in welcoming a guest, you will not be able to serve them well. You can welcome a guest only when your heart is filled with faith and devotion, and you find joy in their arrival. You will not be able to protect your teachings unless your mind is filled with faith and devotion. Only when you welcome your practice with such faith and devotion can you protect it, and such a practice protects you."
1,15,"We are trying to understand the true form of detachment, i.e., the actual state of detachment. As I have said earlier, one must surely try to understand detachment and practice with precision, because these are very important for gaining momentum in yoga practice. Maharshi says, ""A person with controlled senses and steadfast in his vision and hearing, devoid of attachment and longing, is said to be in a state of detachment."" The things seen are (drisht) - subjects of the eyes (worldly beauty), subjects of taste (delicious food, drink), wealth, etc. As long as one is attached to these seen things, detachment cannot be attained. However, it is not that we should not accept the aids that lead us to the path of yoga, because those who are dwelling on the path of yoga are not to be rejected. It is the individual seeker who must determine this for himself. The things heard are (anushravik) - subjects that are heard through scriptures and whose direct experience the seeker does not have. If one's mind is enticed by the fruits of one's actions or is inclined towards them in any way, this state is also an obstacle to yoga and destroys detachment. Therefore, one should understand these heard things solely through the vision of pure knowledge. When the seeker's mind is detached from both types of subjects and moves ahead in life practice, a natural detachment arises within him, which, along with discrimination and practice, leads him to the path of samadhi. Detachment, in simple terms, is being free from attachment, void of desires, and free from attachment. According to Yoga philosophy, this is also known as aparigraha, and it is a means to attained samprajnata samadhi."
1,16,"""This transcendent and elevated renunciation is different from the renunciation we discussed earlier, in which the sadhaka, having realized his true self, becomes free from desire and attachment to the three gunas. This is an extremely high state that is extremely difficult to describe and explain. What are the gunas? Gunas are of three kinds. Renouncing even these three gunas is called Sat-tattva-Vairagya. Where the sadhaka remains only in the state of Chit, only in the state of Jnana, and only in the state of Vritti. According to the commentary of Vyasa, this is considered the highest stage of knowledge. It is called the highest stage of knowledge because the sadhaka experiences that anything that is experienced beyond his own Self is mere maya, i.e., it has come from outside. Therefore, he becomes detached from everything except himself. It can be said that the Self-realization of the jiva-atma makes only the attachment to oneself known, and detachment from everything else is achieved. Thinking about oneself is the greatest riddle, and hence, practice and renunciation do not take away from this thought, but rather make it more powerful, because through this practice and renunciation, practice and renunciation become more firm."""
1,17,"The student asks Maharshi Patanjali how the consciousness that is restrained by the practice of non-attachment (vairagya) and the exercise of the practice of concentration (abhyas) comes to know the fourfold direct experience (samp-rjñāta samādhi). Maharshi Patanjali explains that as one advances on the path of Yoga, one's mind passes through four different stages or states, and it is through the experience of these four states that one achieves the fourfold direct experience. These four states are: vitarka, vicāra, ānanda, and asmitā. 

The fourfold direct experience is not merely a mechanical process but is brought about by the careful examination of the three factors: grahṇā, grahaṇa, and pramāṇa. By understanding these three factors, one can gain insight into the nature of the human being. 

The last and fourth state is asmitā. When the individual self realizes its own true nature and separates itself from the world, and becomes one with its own self, this state is known as asmitā. When the student experiences this state, they come to know the ultimate reality."
1,18,"It is necessary to clearly understand the subtle distinctions between samprajnata and asamprajnata samadhi. Therefore, we ask Maharshi Patel that, having reached samprajnata samadhi, how can one attain asamprajnata samadhi, and what methods, practices, and disciplines are necessary to achieve it? Maharshi Patel says that when all thoughts have ceased, or when all thoughts have stopped, and the aspirant has reached the state through the means of renunciation (vairagya), and keeps practicing and repeating it, then what is left are only samskaras (impressions). These impressions are different from those of samprajnata samadhi. 

Let us analyze this thoroughly. An aspirant is practicing yoga with intense faith, following the eightfold path of Ashtanga Yoga, with well-understood theory and practical knowledge. He also knows the five types of vrittis (thought-waves) and the method to stop the complex vrittis in life. He believes that these five types of complex vrittis are the main obstacles on his spiritual path, and with continuous practice and renunciation, he can overcome them.

He knows that there are two types of samadhi, samprajnata and asamprajnata. Having known this, he experiences samprajnata samadhi through the sequence of vitark, vicar, ananda, and asmita. When, through intense practice, repeated practice, and repetition, he reaches a state where all thoughts in his mind have ceased for some time, then that state is called asamprajnata samadhi.

But even in this state, some samskaras remain. These are known as the samskaras of nirodha, or the impressions of restraint. Just as soon as asamprajnata samadhi is shattered, the aspirant remembers that he was in a state where everything was empty, and there was no thought, only an experience. This experience is impossible without the absence of both samskaras and samskara-generated smriti (memory). Therefore, the state that remains after all thoughts have ceased, and only samskaras are left, is known as asamprajnata samadhi."
1,19,"""Before the beginning of the discourse, Maharshi Vyas says that this unselfish samadhi comes in two forms. One form of unselfish samadhi is that of a yogi who is different from the yogi who has attained vidya and prakriti-laya. The meaning of 'bhava' here is the world, and the philosophical meaning of 'pratyaya' becomes the true knowledge, i.e. the true knowledge of the world. Hence, the yogi who has attained the bhava-pratyaya samadhi is said to have attained true knowledge and is different from the yogi who has attained vidya and prakriti-laya.

The yogi who is embodied (vidya) is one who has overcome the ego, attachment, and identification with the body, uses the body only for its utility, and considers oneself non-doer and accepts God as the doer. They consider the body to be mortal and worship and pray to the one God. They are also an upadhi (an attribute) in the spiritual journey, as they were given to Raja Janak first, hence they are also known as Vidhe Raj.

On the other hand, the yogi who has attained prakriti-laya is one who understands and knows the three gunas (attributes) of nature, which are born of the three gunas and ultimately resolves into the shashvat tattva, i.e., the one God, and worships and prays to Him.

In the bhava-pratyaya samadhi, one experiences the ultimate and highest state of yoga, known as kaivalya. As life is filled with innumerable battles and struggles, if this samadhi breaks, this experience becomes broken and does not remain continuous."""
1,20,"""The above sutra states that the samadhi of vidhayogis and prakritilayas is called bhavapratyaya. Then, the question arises as to how the samadhi of yogis who are different from these is formed, which is called upayapratyaya. Maharshi says that for such yogis, the upayapratyaya samadhi requires the presence of five essentials in their life. These are shraddha, which means unconditional surrender; vairagya, which means renunciation; smriti, which means memory; prajna, which means wisdom; and samadhi, which means concentration. According to Vyasa's commentary, shraddha means the inclination of the mind or a strong desire that arises from a deep sense of surrender and operates like a mother caring for and nourishing the yogi. The one who has shraddha, filled with the feeling of ananya, becomes the devotee. He gets the power of enthusiasm and can bring out the good impressions of past births and experiences, which enables him to regain the path of samadhi. When we connect our present birth with past births, the entire futile struggle stops and the yogi's mind becomes concentrated. Then, he does not run after anything; instead, he becomes one with his consciousness. Prakasha prajna, or the enlightened consciousness, manifests within him. From prakasha prajna, arises vivekah, or discrimination, which, along with regular abhyasa and parivrajya, leads to the attainment of asamprajnata samadhi. This is a systematic and scientific sequence, and without following it, entry into samadhi is completely futile."""
1,21,"""In yoga, the intensity of desire is according to the three main principles of soft, gentle, and intense methods. Soft, gentle, and intense methods also have three types each. Similarly, middle and intense methods should be understood. Now, Yogis who follow the intense method quickly achieve realization in yoga through this sutra explained by Maharsi to his disciples.

Those with deep and high wisdom, detachment, and practice quickly attain realization and its fruit. Maharsi says that if a practitioner practices detachment and practice with complete wisdom, they can attain realization soon without any time limit. This has been explained by Vyasa in two words - samadhi-labha and samadhi-phala. Samadhi-labha is the attainment of realization through intense practice and detachment, and if there is intense desire, realization can be achieved quickly. However, the duration of realization can vary depending on the effort of Yogis, who have nine types. This has also been said by Maharsi Kapil in a Sankhya Sutra - ""Na kala na niyamo vama-devavat"" which means that just as Vama-Deva achieved realization and Kaivalya in a very short time through continuous and intense practice, any other yogi can also achieve it.

The fruit of realization is the experience or state that the practitioner achieves after realizing it, such as having an experience of God, self-realization, controlling thoughts, emotions, and actions, experiencing bliss beyond pleasure and pain, and being liberated from all attachment and achieving eternal bliss."""
1,22,"""The elevated practice and detachment mentioned in the previous sutra also have three categories - mild, medium, and intense - just like the objects of the world. Therefore, even those who have practiced and detached themselves according to these three categories will get quicker and more elevated self-realization and its fruits. The sage is trying to convey through this sutra that everything in life gets categorized into three - mild, medium, and intense. Similarly, the practice and detachment have three aspects - mild, medium, and intense - depending on which, the practitioner gets self-realization and its fruits. The intensity of self-realization and detachment in getting the fruits is correlated with the previous birth's impressions. If the previous birth's impressions are favorable, self-realization is achieved quickly, but if they are unfavorable, it takes more time. The sage emphasizes that one's own efforts, the environment of the current birth, and the quality of the company one keeps are all crucial factors. If the company one keeps is good, leading to divine contemplation and a positive path, it is helpful in achieving self-realization. On the other hand, bad company leads to worldly attachment and unholy actions. The individual's own longing or desire also plays a crucial role - if it is meek, self-realization may take more time, but if it is excessive, self-realization can come quickly."""
1,23,"""The disciple asks, driven by curiosity, if there are any other means, apart from what has been mentioned earlier, to achieve rapid realization. Maharshi Patanjali replies that even Ishwar-pranidhana can lead to rapid realization. Let us understand the meaning of the first verse: 

Being aware that oneself is subject to Ishwar in all ways, surrendering oneself to Ishwar, becoming a means, and being free from all motivations and desires, doing all actions as worship, offering, and service to Ishwar. This is called Ishwar-pranidhana, and it bestows rapid realization.

Ishwar-pranidhana is the highest devotion. It is the highest surrender to one's Ishta. Ishwar-pranidhana is the only state that can remove all the limitations of a human being. Whether it is the complexities of life or the impurities of the mind, fear, worry, anxiety, guilt, shame, or anything else, it all comes to an end in this state. However, to attain this state, one has to have the greatest courage, which is complete reliance on Ishwar, and this is the greatest protection for the seeker.

Ishwar-pranidhana is the purest and most straightforward sadhana methodology, where there is nothing to discuss or explain. If one considers it as the origin of ease and simplicity, then it can be said that it is Ishwar-pranidhana, because it brings about ease, simplicity, fearlessness, and independence. This stage of Ishwar-pranidhana is bound to come on the path of sadhana.

Ishwar-pranidhana is the art of living in the shelter of which one is protected from all worries, unknown fears, anxiety, and complexities. Blessed is the life that begins to live on the foundation of Ishwar-pranidhana."""

Ashukla karma, and 3. Shukla-ashukla karma. The Bhagavad Gita categorizes karma into three: 1. Karma, 2. A-karma, and 3. Vikarma. When the results of karma start to manifest, it is referred to as vipaka. Ishvara, since He performs karma without desire, is not affected by karma and is thus free from vipaka. When one experiences the results of karma, desires arise, which are referred to as ashaya in yogic philosophy. Sometimes, ashaya is also referred to as the desire that arises when one is yet to experience the results of karma. Ishvara is free from all desires, therefore He is ashaya-free. Since individuals cannot escape their own desires, karma, and its fruits through their desires, Ishvara is referred to as the special individual by Maharshi Patanjali."""
1,25,"""It is said in the above sloka that God is the ultimate reality. Maharishi Patanjali says that God is the embodiment of Absolute Knowledge, which is beyond all limitations and is in its culmination. 'Atishaya' means that which is infinite and boundless. When someone says something that surpasses the ordinary, it is called Atishaya. 'Niratisaya' means that which is beyond the sphere of increase and decrease, beyond all permutations. Thus, God's Omniscience is beyond all limitations, beyond time and space. 'Atishaya' is the state of God's Omniscience, which is beyond all human comprehension. It is not that God is only Omniscient about Knowledge, but He is also the embodiment of all good qualities, natural qualities, and all types of Auspiciousness, and He is the foundation of all Auspiciousness."""
1,26,"He is the Guru of all spiritual masters, Brahmins, and Gurus born before Him, because He is not bound by time and is beyond it. It is not that He exists in some time and does not exist in another - He is present in all time. He exists before creation and after destruction. He is considered the Guru of all Gurus because He is eternal. He is the first teacher, and He imparted knowledge to the four original Rishis. He is the Guru of the four Vedas, and He is the one who illuminated the self-knowledge and spiritual understanding of the Rishis. The four Rishis are Agni, Aditya, Vayu, and Angiras.

As mentioned in the Upanishads, ""I, a seeker of truth, take refuge in the God who created Brahma and illuminated the Rishis with the knowledge of the Vedas and their meaning."" Even the ancient Brahmins, who glorified the greatness of Brahma, had the God as their Guru. He guided them on the right path and inspired them to follow the righteous path. From the worldly perspective, I would say that God is the Guru of all Gurus, but in the world, the Guru is an embodiment and representative of that Supreme God.

This is a fundamental truth that God is the ultimate Guru, but the Guru who takes us to that God is also true. This is also mentioned in a famous couplet by Kabir:

""There are two Gurus, God and the one who shows us God. The one who showed me God, I consider as my Guru."""
1,27,"""Maharshi had explained about God in the previous four sutras. The curious disciples asked Maharshi what God's true name was. If we want to remember His name, what should we call Him? Maharshi replied that God's true name is Aum, also known as Pranav. Aum is also referred to as the primary sound. The sound of Aum is spread all over the universe. In one sense, the pronunciation of God's name is what maintains the entire creation and the universe. Earlier, a sutra had come, 'Ishvarapranidhanadva' (1/23), which means that one attains self-realization quickly through devotion to God and surrendering all actions and their fruits to Him. God's devotion involves the importance of chanting His name, so knowing His true name is also necessary. This was mentioned in this sutra, keeping this in mind. In future sutras, too, the term 'Ishvarapranidhan' will come up again. When we call out to our deity, adored one, or beloved, their remembrance becomes clearer. That's why the name becomes dearer to us, and His natural qualities begin to manifest within us. Maharshi explained how to chant God's name in the next session."""
1,28,"""The repetition of the Om mantra, along with the meaning of the words and one's emotions, should be done repeatedly. There are many types of repetition, including four main categories: vocal repetition, subtle repetition, mental repetition, and wordless repetition. Vocal repetition involves chanting loudly, while subtle repetition is done by whispering softly, and mental repetition is done quietly, focusing on the meaning of the words. Wordless repetition occurs when one's mind is fully absorbed in the act of repetition and the words become meaningless.

Vocal repetition involves repeating the words loudly, such as 'Om Om Om', and is believed to bring success in one's communication. Subtle repetition is done by slowly and quietly repeating the words, and is believed to bring inner peace and contemplation. Mental repetition involves repeating the words in one's mind, and is believed to be a thousand times more effective than other forms of repetition. Wordless repetition occurs when one's mind is fully absorbed in the act of repetition and the words become meaningless, and is believed to bring about true devotion and connection with the divine.

It's important to remember that repetition should be done with the correct meaning and emotions, otherwise, it will not bring the expected benefits. The repetition of the Om mantra, in particular, is believed to have various meanings and benefits, and should be understood and practiced accordingly. It's also important to note that it's not just the repetition of the words, but the emotions and meaning behind them that make it effective."""
1,29,"What realisation comes from this subject, Maharishi explains, quoting this sutra. The beauty of these yoga sutras is that each sutra is connected to the previous one in some way. In this series, Maharishi has described the description of God's true name, Om, and how to chant it. Therefore, a natural curiosity arose in the minds of the disciples as to what benefit or realisation they would gain by chanting it with meaning. Maharishi says that by doing so or by dedicating oneself to God, a practitioner can break free from not only the obstacles that arise on the path to yoga, but also from the obstacles that arise from ignorance, along with the obstacles that arise on the path to yoga. Initially, by dedicating oneself to God, the practitioner starts to experience their own self, like ""Who am I?"", ""What is the purpose of my coming to this world?"", ""From where did I come?"" and so on, and this leads to a sense of liberation and makes it easier to progress further on the path to yoga. As we move forward on any path, we encounter obstacles, and similarly, a practitioner who walks the path of yoga also encounters obstacles. We will discuss these obstacles in detail in the next session, and look at each obstacle separately, and also examine the ways to overcome them. Therefore, by doing japa along with meaning, a practitioner gains knowledge of oneself and becomes free from the obstacles that arise on the path to yoga. A term used in this sutra is 'pratybakarna'. Its meaning is that when the consciousness of the self detaches from objects and becomes introverted, this tendency of the self is called 'pratybakarna'. Another term used by Maharishi in this sutra is 'antaraya'. In yoga, the meaning of 'antaraya' is 'obstacle', 'vibration', or 'blockage'."
1,30,"Before, the obstacles and hindrances that come on the path of yoga were mentioned. In this sutra, a detailed description of them is given. Maharishi has mentioned all the obstacles in this sutra on request of the followers. These obstacles are: disease, lack of interest, self-doubt, negligence, attachment to worldly things, wrong perceptions, lack of progress, lack of stability, and ignorance. These obstacles obstruct the path of yoga.

Yogis who have not cultivated the habit of yoga in their previous lives are more prone to these obstacles. They should not be discouraged by these obstacles and should continue their practice with determination.

There is a misconception that yogis do not need a physical body. But, in reality, a physical body is necessary for yoga. Swami Ramdev has cleared this misconception and shown the path to overcome this first obstacle.

It is extremely important to overcome this first obstacle, which is disease. If one's first step is incorrect, it will lead to a wrong direction, and one will not be able to reach the destination. Therefore, one should focus on overcoming this first obstacle.

The other eight obstacles are related to the body, mind, intelligence, and ignorance. These obstacles can be overcome through inner efforts, understanding, practice, detachment, and discrimination.

If one cultivates a complete holistic approach to one's physical body, the other eight obstacles will also automatically reduce. When the question of physical health arises, factors such as diet, thoughts, behavior, habits, and lifestyle also become relevant.

In this regard, disease is not the only obstacle. When all the aspects are taken care of, the obstacles gradually disappear. It is not that, by just overcoming disease, one can attain self-realization. But, by overcoming disease, one can overcome other obstacles with great ease and gain self-realization. There is no doubt about this."
1,31,"Maharshi spoke about the nine obstacles on the path of yoga, along with their results, which can themselves become obstacles. These four afflictions manifest in various ways, making it seem like there are 13 obstacles instead of nine. 

The four obstacles are: दुखदौर्मनस्य (sorrow, laziness, and restlessness), अंगमेजयत्व (pleasure derived from sense gratification), श्वासप्रश्वास (irregular breathing), and विक्षेप (distraction). 

Each individual experiences sorrow, and when they experience it, they want to escape from it instantly. No one wants to remain in sorrow. It's not just about escaping, but also making an effort to achieve liberation from sorrow. 

Scriptures categorize sorrow in three ways: self-caused, caused by other living beings, and caused by natural forces, such as floods and droughts. Self-caused sorrow arises from mental sufferings and physical diseases, caused by factors like desire, anger, greed, attachment, hatred, and false perception. 

Sorrow caused by other living beings arises from harm caused by animals, insects, and other such creatures. Sorrow caused by natural forces is due to natural disasters like floods, droughts, etc. 

One should strive to overcome self-caused sorrow, which is in one's own hands. Overcoming sorrow caused by other living beings requires awareness and caution. However, sorrow caused by natural forces is beyond individual control and requires collective efforts to maintain the balance of the environment. 

Daurmanasya is the feeling of dissatisfaction that arises when one cannot fulfill their desires. It leads to disappointment, inaction, and disinterest in spiritual practices. 

Angamejyata is the pleasure derived from sense gratification, which leads to attachment and imbalance in one's physical body. 

Irregular breathing, or Shwasa-Praswasa, is another obstacle on the path of yoga. 

These obstacles, including duukha, daurmanasya, angamejyata, and irregular breathing, arise from the balance of the mind and are obstacles on the path of yoga. They can be overcome through practice and renunciation."
1,32,"One must practice a specific and continuous technique, determined by scripture, in order to prevent or eliminate distractions and obstacles. The question arises as to what this technique is and how it is to be practiced so that we can eliminate the 9 obstacles and 4 sub-obstacles on the path of yoga. The addition of the word ""ek"" before ""tatva"" has significant importance. Maharshi did not utter any word futilely in the entire Yoga philosophy. Each word is significant here. Just as Maharshi explained the importance of continuous and consistent practice in aphorism 14 of Samadhi Pada, similarly, the addition of the word ""ek"" before ""tatva"" explains the importance of this technique. There are many methods and practices available to eliminate obstacles, but even these will not be effective if we do not practice a specific method. Maharshi stresses that only the practice of one technique will enable us to overcome these obstacles and attain fulfillment. Through the practice of this technique, focus will be developed, and the mind will become concentrated, allowing us to move forward on the path of yoga. In aphorism 23, it is mentioned that only through the practice of this technique can we eliminate obstacles and attain fulfillment. This technique is to repeat the mantra ""Omkar"" with the meaning of ""Arth Bhavana"", and its continuous and uninterrupted practice will help the practitioner attain focus and eliminate all distractions. In the next aphorism, Maharshi will explain the method for obtaining the satisfaction of the mind, as it is not possible to completely eliminate distractions without mental satisfaction. When the practitioner's mind is peaceful and satisfied, it is possible to eliminate all distractions through the practice of this technique. However, when the mind is not peaceful and satisfied, it is necessary to find a method not only for practicing this technique but also for obtaining mental satisfaction, and only then will complete success be achieved."
1,33,"""When we have friends and acquaintances who are happy and sad, virtuous and wicked, our mind becomes serene and pure by maintaining friendship, compassion, joy, and indifference towards them. There are four types of people in this world with whom we interact daily. By interacting with them, we often become happy and sad due to ignorance. The science of behavior has its own science, and Maharsi Patanjali has given it to the world in a sutra. This science is universal and applicable to all human beings. 

To obtain the serenity of the mind, whenever we discuss this topic, we will first describe Maharsi's sutra. This sutra says that we will encounter four types of people in this world, and we should behave towards them with a certain perspective. 

Regarding people who appear happy, we should maintain a sense of friendship. Towards those who appear sad, we should show compassion. Those who are virtuous, we should associate with admiration. And those who are wicked, we should keep at a distance with indifference. 

What happens when we maintain friendship with happy people? - Let us understand this science. When we behave towards happy people with a sense of friendship, our mind becomes calm and radiant, and we also become more and more happy. As we interact more with happy people, our mind becomes more and more calm. Happy people are natural inspiration and attract us. Therefore, if we behave towards happy people as friends, we will attract more happiness. 

What happens when we show compassion towards the sad? - Let us understand this science as well. Maharshi has instructed us to show compassion towards the sad, not to be overwhelmed by their sorrow. Because if we show sorrow towards the sad, we will also become sad. But by showing compassion, we will stay calm and remain sensitive. We will also be able to assist them in their suffering, and our minds will remain pure. 

What happens when we show joy towards virtuous people? - Let us understand this science as well. As human beings, we should be aware of our natural inclinations and cultivate them. Maharshi is guiding us to cultivate our natural inclinations. When we see someone doing good, we should feel joyful and praise them if possible. By doing so, we will become more and more calm and our mind will become more and more radiant. 

What happens when we show indifference towards those who are wicked? - Let us understand this science as well"
1,34,"""The state of the mind becomes concentrated or one-pointed when air in the lungs is expelled rapidly and then retained outside, or when the mind is expanded through the practice of Pranayama. This sutra mentions two specific words. Prachchardana refers to the expulsion of air from the lungs rapidly. Vidhavana refers to the retention of air outside. These two practices are said to be the means of steadying the mind. Whenever the mind is disturbed, restless, or unconscious, or when laziness and procrastination take over, every individual should use these practices to calm their mind and achieve stability. This stability can lead to higher states of awareness, taking the individual up to the realm of self-realization. There are three main divisions of Pranayama - Rechaka, Puraka, and Kumbhaka. Rechaka is the expulsion of air from the lungs, Puraka is the intake of air, and Kumbhaka is the retention of air. Of these three, two practices are mentioned in this sutra, namely Prachchardana and Vidhavana. Scientific principles reveal that the mind and prana are interdependent and mutually affect each other. Any activity or process that balances the mind and prana can have a positive impact, whereas any imbalance can have negative consequences. When the practitioner practices Prachchardana and Vidhavana, the pranic vibrations resonate with the mind, causing it to settle into a state of stability, and the mind becomes tranquil and free from distractions. This is a scientific truth - that the mind can only be calmed or stabilized through the practice of Pranayama or some other technique. The extent to which one can understand and control the mind is directly proportional to the stability of the mind. This is why the existence of Ashtanga Yoga. Prachchardana and Vidhavana are among the prominent means of steadying the mind. In the next five sutras, Maharshi will discuss the state of the mind or the manner in which the mind is concentrated."""
1,35,"""What was born out of the five senses (form, taste, smell, touch, and sound) also provides the mind with concentration and stability, making it peaceful and pure. Of these five senses, some can be designated as the main subject for concentration, and this gives rise to a supreme cognitive state, making the mind peaceful, serene, and pure. This state is essential for attaining union with the Self through yoga. Just as it was mentioned earlier, yoga is only possible in two states of consciousness - single-pointedness and non-dual awareness. Until the aspirant achieves single-pointedness, they cannot progress on the path of yoga. Therefore, the aspirant must achieve single-pointedness.

The question now is, which of the five senses should be taken as the medium for practice? Has there been a fixed sequence prescribed by the seers? We can decide for ourselves what medium to choose. When the aspirant sits with eyes closed, in padmasana or any other comfortable pose, and takes the senses as the medium, the sound sensory will be the first to manifest. Therefore, it is best to start with sound.

When the seers wrote these lines, nature was their companion, and they wrote with Nature's guidance. Thus, all practices for mental stabilization and purification should be done in proximity to nature. Close your eyes, sit comfortably, and use the sound of a river or a similar natural sound as the medium for practice. Gradually, the other four senses will withdraw, and the mind will become focused, with all thoughts and distractions leaving it. When the mind becomes one with sound, it will experience a sense of unity and eventually attain the state of pure awareness.

The seers say that the practice of sound alone is sufficient to attain this state. The sound sensory is most easily accessible, and it is the most accommodating medium for practice. When the aspirant focuses their attention on the sound, the mind becomes peaceful and purified. Similarly, the practice of form or shape can also lead to mental purification and stability.

When the aspirant wants to practice through the sense of smell, they can take a fragrant substance or the scent of flowers and use it as the medium. In this way, they can experience a sense of purification and stability. When they listen to the sound of the sea or a similar sound, they should not worry about the sensations that arise but should keep their attention focused on the sound. Similarly,"
1,36,"""A seeker's mind becomes stable and purified even by the process of creating a state of detachment and fullness of consciousness. In the same way, a similar state of fullness of consciousness, called Vishoka Jyotishmatri, also makes the mind stable, peaceful, and pure. According to the Vyas Bhashya, there are two types of this state: Vishwatmika Jyotishmatri and Asmita Jyotishmatri. In this state, the sattva guna is more prominent, while the rajo and tamo gunas are absent. It is only because of the absence of the rajo and tamo gunas that it is called Vishoka. Sorrow arises from the rajo and tamo gunas. Some practitioners of meditation tell us that in the region of the heart, above the navel, there is a lotus flower with its face downwards. When one rapidly exhales and prevents the breath from going out, the lotus flower turns upwards, and the practitioner begins to experience blooming. In the middle of this lotus flower, there is the symbol Om. This lotus flower has a direct connection with the Brahmanadi, which is associated with the sun, the moon, and other worlds. When a yogi or sadhak becomes one-pointed at this point, a satvic light begins to shine in the soul. The yogi experiences a golden light everywhere, which makes his mind deeper and more peaceful. Some yogis say that by mentally visualizing the satvic light in the middle of the eyebrows, one begins to see glimpses of light there, and through deeper practice, that light spreads throughout the entire body. As a result, the sadhak's mind becomes absorbed in that light and begins to experience himself as a manifestation of that light."""
1,37,"""The minds of yogis whose consciousness has transcended the limitations of the ego and has become free from passions and desires, can bring a similar state of equanimity and purity to the mind of the seeker. By adopting the same mindset and behavior as the yogis whose consciousness has transcended the limitations of the ego, the seeker can attain the same state of equanimity and purity.

To experience this, the seeker should follow the same path as these yogis. For instance, the seeker should sit comfortably in any posture, close their eyes, and place their mind on the consciousness of a yogi whose consciousness has transcended the limitations of the ego. They should focus their mind on the state of equanimity and purity that this yogi has attained.

By doing so, the seeker's mind will become calm and tranquil, and they will experience a sense of detachment from the external world. Their mind will become free from passion and desire, and they will attain the state of equanimity and purity that they seek.

The seeker should not attempt to deliberately bring their mind to a state of equanimity and purity, but should rather allow themselves to be guided by the consciousness of the yogi. They should allow themselves to be drawn into the state of equality and unity that this yogi has attained.

As they sit in meditation, the seeker's mind will gradually become calm and tranquil, and they will experience a sense of detachment from the external world. Their mind will become free from passion and desire, and they will attain the state of equanimity and purity that they seek.

Such a state is not a permanent state, but it can be attained by repeating this practice regularly. With each repetition, the seeker's mind will become more calm and tranquil, and they will experience a greater sense of detachment from the external world.

The consciousness of the yogi is a powerful tool that can bring a state of equanimity and purity to the seeker's mind. By adopting the same mindset and behavior as the yogi, the seeker can attain the same state of equanimity and purity.

In today's time, we have guides like Swami Ramdev who have attained this state of equanimity and purity, and we can learn from them. By following their guidance, we can also attain this state and experience a greater sense of detachment from the external world."
1,38,"""Even a mind that takes the foundation of knowledge derived from dreams and sleep can bestow stability and tranquility on the mind. According to scriptures, there are three primary states: wakefulness, sleep, and deep sleep. In the waking state, the predominance of rajas guna and the suppression of tamas guna cause a person's vasanas to flow outward. In sleep, tamas guna increases and rajas guna is suppressed, causing vasanas to flow inward (introverted). The sleep state can also be divided into two parts: dreams and sattvic sleep. For individuals who possess a good sattvic vasana and experience sattvic dreams, a way is explained. They recommend that when a person gets up in the morning, they should try to remember the knowledge gained from dreams for some time. If one can memorize that knowledge and keep it as an anchor during concentration, the mind will remain calm and pure. Without this, even the knowledge gained from sleep can be an anchor for the mind, leading to stability and tranquility. Maharsi has described all these techniques to his disciples, and there is no limit to these techniques. Knowing this, he has also revealed the ultimate technique for obtaining peace next session."""
1,39,"""The methods cited earlier are not the only ones that can bring peace and purity to the mind. Depending on one's nature, one can choose the method that seems suitable and easy to understand. Even if one follows or practices these methods, the mind will become peaceful and pure. This sutra has two ways of being interpreted. One, some people may interpret this sutra to only include the methods mentioned earlier, excluding other methods. However, Maharshi says that there is no need to rely solely on these methods. There are many other means to maintain peace and purity of the mind. Therefore, one can choose the method that suits their nature and use it to calm the mind. According to my opinion, Maharshi did not reject other possibilities in composing this sutra. In each sutra, they say, ""Do not use this method if it is not suitable."" In Maharshi's time, many methods were prevalent. When some prominent methods were cited, no rejection of other methods was intended. Therefore, this sutra was said."""
1,40,"""The ways of purifying and stabilizing the mind, which have been mentioned earlier, should be practiced with sincerity. The adept who practices these methods will gain knowledge of even the smallest and the largest, and the most magnificent things. The fruits of any practice, sadhana, or method can be seen in two ways. Immediate fruits are peace, clarity, and stability of the mind, while long-term fruits are the attainment of higher states and special abilities. By virtue of this kind of purified mind, the adept will be able to grasp even the smallest and largest things, and bring them under control. The adept will even be capable of controlling the most magnificent things. When a practitioner's mind is steady and unmoved, without any obstacle, and is suspended in the subtlest, i.e., atomic, state, and in the vast 'space', he will attain supreme control."""
1,41,"""The yogi whose subtle inclinations are dominated by sattvic qualities and whose awareness is spotless and pure, like a crystal mirror, takes in the form of whatever object comes its way. When the mind is utterly pure and spotless, it takes on the form of that very object, just as an untainted crystal mirror reflects the color of the object placed before it. Therefore, when Maharshi spoke of the various methods and techniques, he asked the question: What is the form of that completely tranquil and pure mind? The answer to this question is this sutra. When the mind is pure and untainted, Maharshi likened it to an untainted crystal mirror, which has no color of its own, but reflects the color of the object placed before it. Similarly, when the mind becomes so pure that it is free from the influences of rajasic and tamasic qualities, the object that comes before it takes on the form of that very object, just as Maharshi described. This is the state of samprajnata samadhi, which is also called the state of cessation. It is essential for a sadhak to regulate their daily life in a sattvic manner, as any carelessness can lead to a downfall. Although the mind is pure and unblemished, it can still be affected by any undesirable thought that enters it, since it has the capacity to grasp the form of that thought, which is also known as direct perception. Therefore, the observance of a pure and regulated life is crucial for a sadhak."""
1,42,"""The cognition that arises from the combination of three factors - word, meaning, and knowledge - is called savitarka samapatti. This understanding arises from a complex process, and for ordinary people, it may seem difficult to grasp. 

The word refers to the sound we utter with our mouths and hear with our ears. For example, the word ""Rohit"" is the name of a boy, and ""Hathi"" is the name of an elephant.

The meaning refers to the special significance or essence inherent in the word. For example, when we hear the word ""Ram,"" we understand it to be the name of a king, Dasharath's son, who had Sita as his partner and had Hanuman as his devotee, who defeated Ravana, the king of Lanka, and killed him.

The knowledge refers to the ability to cognize the special meaning of the word, which arises from the combination of word, meaning, and knowledge. 

In reality, word, meaning, and knowledge are three separate processes. However, due to practice and habit, we often feel that word and meaning are one and the same. 

For a yogi, however, this is not the case. When the yogi enters a state of concentration, he can see the word, meaning, and knowledge separately. This is the state of savitarka samapatti.

When a child learns to speak, he experiences a complex process. Whenever he hears a word, he tries to fit it with objects around him. For example, when someone says ""give me water,"" the child thinks of a glass, and when someone says ""keep the water for bathing,"" the child thinks of a big bucket. 

However, when the child becomes certain, he understands that water is the liquid substance that is present in a glass, bucket, or pipe, and this liquid substance is water. 

In this way, the child's understanding of the word evolves from being separate to becoming one with its meaning. This is the process of savitarka samapatti.

Similarly, as a yogi's understanding of words, meanings, and knowledge becomes one, he attains the state of savitarka samapatti.

We will now describe nirvitarka samapatti."""
1,43,"""When the memory is purified, the intellect becomes empty like a hollow, and the mind starts to manifest only in terms of its meaning. This state is called nirvikalpa samadhi. Let's understand this sutra a little further. Maharshi Patanjali has studied the internal structure of human beings and has explained it in these sutras, which are useful for us to understand and follow. However, those who have not experienced nirvikalpa samadhi find it difficult to imagine this state. But with a little effort, we can mentally experience this state. 

In this world, the existence of everything is expressed through three states: word, meaning, and knowledge. If a word has no meaning, its existence cannot be experienced. Similarly, if the meaning of a word is incorrect, it cannot be experienced. For example, ""the flower of the sky"" is a wrong statement, as there is no such thing as a flower in the sky. 

When we first see a mobile phone, we are familiar with its size, shape, and functioning. As we use it, our memory creates an image of it. Similarly, when we use a concept or an object, our memory constructs its meaning. When we are in a state of nirvikalpa samadhi, these memories and meanings are absent, and only the meaning that is experienced in the present moment remains. 

In this state, the word and its meaning do not appear, but only the meaning itself appears. It is a unique state, and can only be achieved through continuous practice of yoga."""
1,44,"""The two types of self-realization, namely, nirviti and saviti, should be explained and analyzed along with their explanation. Just as we have explained nirviti and saviti in the previous two sutras, we should similarly understand nirvichi and savichi. Nirviti and saviti are concerned with gross phenomena, while nirvichi and savichi are concerned with subtle phenomena. The gross phenomena are like the physical bodies, where words, meaning, and knowledge are separate, resulting in the nirviti state. Similarly, in subtle phenomena, such as atoms, words, meaning, and knowledge are mixed, resulting in the savichi state. In general, words, meaning, and knowledge do not appear to us as separate entities, but yogis who have advanced on the path of yoga, can recognize the subtle atoms by separating them from the alternatives of words, meaning, and knowledge. Gradually, the yogi's consciousness becomes purified, and they are left with only the essence or the meaning.

The discussion of the gross and subtle has been concluded here, with the explanation of the four types of self-realization. The limits of the subtle have been asked by the disciples to Maharshi, and the answer lies in the next sutra."""
1,45,"The subtlety of subject matter, that is the subtlety of gross objects, remains as far as the primary nature. Maharshi also said in the earlier sutra, ""The subtlety of subject matter is expounded"". Now, we are explaining the subtlety of subject matter in this sutra. We will see what this subtlety is and how far it goes. In the explanations of the earlier sutra, it was said that Savitarka and Nirvitarka samadhi are associated with gross beings, while Savichara and Nirvichara samadhi are associated with subtle beings. Therefore, the question arises as to how far this subtlety is possible. Hence, Maharshi says that if we examine the subtle subject matter of atoms in gross objects, it will reach the related subtlety and if we investigate further, the subtle subject matter of all subtleties will be ""Ahamkara"" the principle. Ahamkara's subtle subject matter will be ""Mahattattva"". And finally, when we investigate the subtle subject matter of Mahattattva, we will find its limit ""Aling"", that is, the primary nature. Beyond the primary nature, there is no subtlety of gross objects. From the perspective of Samkhya, when the analysis of principles is done, 25 principles are mentioned. These 25 principles are: 1. Purusha, 2. Prakriti, 3. Mahattattva (Buddhi, Linga), 4. Ahamkara, 5. Chakshu, 6. Karna, 7. Nasika, 8. Jihva, 9. Tvaka, 10. Vak, 11. Pani, 12. Pada, 13. Payu, 14. Upastha, 15. Man, 16. Shabda, 17.

1,46,"""All these states (sva-vitarka, nirodha-vitarka, sva-samjna, and asamjna-parinama-samapatti) are salambana samadhi. Maharshi has referred to the four types of samadhi (sva-vitarka, nirodha-vitarka, sva-samjna, and asamjna-parinama-samapatti) as salambana samadhi. This means that there is an external cause that becomes the basis for this type of samadhi, and as long as this external cause is present, the experiencer can experience the samadhi. If the external cause ceases to be present, the samadhi will be broken. Maharshi wrote samadhi as salambana to clearly indicate that there should also be a state that is independent of external causes and is not dependent on them. In the following sutras, we will study in detail the topic of nirbija samadhi, but for now, we understand that these four states are salambana, meaning they are dependent on external causes. In previous sutras, we have also explained that sva-vitarka and nirodha-vitarka samapatti occur in gross objects (earth, pot, tree, flower, etc.), and sva-samjna and asamjna-parinama-samapatti occur in subtle objects like tanmatras, senses, and their objects, or in the mind, ego, intellect, or soul. Therefore, since all these states have external causes, they are referred to as salambana samadhi."""
1,47,"When one practices the state of nirvicara, if one achieves siddhi, then as a result, the form of the object appears to the practitioner as it is. The impurities in the practitioner's mind, which existed before the yoga practice, are purged, and as a result, the mind is filled with the light of satva, leading to a state of clarity and flow. In yogic language, this is called adhyatmic prasada. In simple terms, the result of achieving nirvicara is the purification of the mind, and with a pure mind, one sees the object as it is. One also gains understanding of the true nature. With the experience of adhyatmic prasada, the practitioner develops the ability to transcend their circumstances and comprehend the events happening within themselves. Their mind gains the power to make accurate judgments. Just as a person standing on a high mountain can see distant objects with clarity and gain a wide view, similarly, when one achieves the state of nirvicara, one gains the attainment of pure mind or prajna."
1,48,"When one attains the state of divine grace, a particular cognitive faculty is born, which accepts only true knowledge and rejects contradictory or false knowledge. This faculty is established in the awakened state, and one's intellect is illuminated. The two functions of the intellect are: 1) grasping knowledge and 2) determining truth.

The intellect, having acquired this special faculty, becomes the embodiment of truth. Truth is not relative, but absolute, and is not affected by changing circumstances or context. The universe operates according to the laws of nature, and since these laws are unchanging, the universe itself remains unchanging.

When a yogi's intellect is filled with this special faculty, they are no longer beset by doubts or confusion. They no longer experience duality, and their thoughts and actions become pure and unwavering. Through this, they attain a state of equanimity, and their ego is dissolved.

The yogi, now free from worldly attachments, can focus on their spiritual journey. They can contemplate on the mysteries of the universe, the relationship between the individual self and the universe, and the nature of ultimate reality.

Through the attainment of this special faculty, the yogi becomes equipped to navigate the ultimate reality and experience the ultimate truth. They can also attain a state of self-realization, where they see themselves as a part of the universe and understand the interconnectedness of all things.

The ways to attain this special faculty are: 1) to cultivate self-surrender, 2) to subtly analyze one's own defects and motivations, 3) to observe one's thoughts, feelings, and behavior with a critical eye, and 4) to transcend one's defects and limitations by accepting and embracing duality, rather than trying to control or manipulate it."
1,49,"""The sage Patanjali wants to explain something special about direct perception, which is different from ordinary intelligence through this sutra. The students were wondering how direct perception is different from ordinary intelligence, and Patanjali says that direct perception is a knowledge that arises from proof and inference, and is distinct from it. It is clear that for the yogi who has achieved direct perception, a knowledge is obtained that is beyond proof and inference, and is both different and unique. This knowledge can only be experienced when a sadhak and yogi obtain it. Only then can we understand that the sadhak or yogi has a self- spontaneous inspiration, and a knowledge arise in his mind, heart, or inner self, accompanied by a powerful feeling that indicates that this self-spontaneous knowledge is completely true and eternal. This powerful feeling, born with knowledge, makes the yogi or sadhak certain. This direct perception, freed from attachment and aversion, is the gift of the self to the yogi. The literal meaning of ""prasad"" (gift) is also the one that brings joy. In yoga, everything is connected internally. When we discipline our inner impurities or complex tendencies through practice and detachment, and become fully established in pure tendencies, then direct perception also begins to arise within us. The yogi and sadhak experience the call of direct perception as it begins to dawn on them."""
1,50,"""Maharshi expounded in detail on the subject of Ritambara Pragna in the two preceding sutras. What is the nature of Ritambara Pragna and what benefits does a yogi gain from it, these topics were discussed. Now, we will discuss how Ritambara Pragna assists in achieving self-realization through the present sutra. When Ritambara Pragna arises, unfathomable courage and self-strength arise within the yogi. The yogi's tendencies take birth within him which lead him towards self-discipline and prevent the manifestation of accumulated bad tendencies in a practical way. The first free-flowing state of bad tendencies, habits, or obstacles to yoga is obstructed from arising. The yogi's inner strength awakens and becomes established in the state of detachment, enabling him to strongly curb or abandon difficult tendencies, bad habits, defects, or so-called bad tendencies. From this point onward, the actual struggle begins in his life and he starts winning over bad tendencies. After being fulfilled by Ritambara Pragna, the yogi destroys bad tendencies with the power of understanding and courage and remains only with Ritambara Pragna, wandering spontaneously with self-aware consciousness."""
1,51,"""Thus, when a yogi is endowed with the knowledge of the Absolute, generated by the cultivation of good habits, and is capable of completely stopping all bad habits, he then starts to arrest even the habit of habitual thinking. When the yogi's mind, generated by the knowledge of the Absolute, gives up or arrests the habit of ignorance or attachment, a specific state is established, known as the seedless or un-manifested samadhi. This is considered the highest state on the yogic path where all sorts of habits (whether good or bad) are completely destroyed, and their seeds do not remain. One example to understand this is: imagine you went to the jungle for a walk and, while walking, a thorn pricked your foot. In attempting to remove the thorn from your foot, you end up breaking another thorn and then try to remove the pricked thorn. After a little effort, the pricked thorn is removed, and you also discard the thorn with which you were removing the other thorn. No sensible person retains a thorn in their heart, thinking that this thorn helped remove the other thorn, so it is important to me. One thing is clear: as long as the memory of the thorn or the option to prick remains, the thorn cannot be removed from your life. Similarly, the yogi, endowed with the knowledge of the Absolute, generated by the cultivation of good habits, removes all his bad habits and vices and, then, with effort, frees himself from this habit as well. As a result, he no longer gets entangled in the cycle of good or bad habits or ways of thinking. Let this be firmly settled that as long as even good habits remain in the form of a seed in a person, there are possibilities of the bad habits rising again. This is an unshakeable truth. For an individual, this is the ultimate destination of the journey of becoming a yogi, and we must all ultimately align our life's direction and destination in this direction."""
2,1,"""The first sutra of this science is kriya yoga. After introducing the fundamental and advanced principles of yoga in the samadhi chapter, Maharsi Sada's discourse begins. In kriya yoga, the threefold pattern of yoga, namely tapasya, self-study, and surrender to the Lord, is practiced. Any individual who wants to start their yoga journey can practice these three techniques together. There is no special qualification required for this. 

Tap: To endure the twosided, which are pleasure and pain, gain and loss, respect and disrespect, and other such adversities. A seeker must learn to endure these adversities through regular practice. 

Self-study: Is the study of the self and the study of scriptures that help to reveal the highest principles of the self and bring about purification of the mind. 

Surrender to the Lord: Is the dedication of all one's actions, words, and thoughts to the Lord, without any desire for reward. 

Through the combined practice of these three techniques, a seeker becomes established on the path of yoga. The present discourse provides a comprehensive overview of kriya yoga, which serves as a guide for all seekers on the path of yoga. The practice of these three techniques, and the non-attachment to the world, are essential for the realization of the highest state of consciousness. 

It is said that one who does not practice tap, and surrender to the Lord, cannot attain the state of yoga. Similarly, one who does not practice self-study, cannot understand the highest principles of the self. 

It is essential for a seeker to continue this practice, and to persevere in the face of adversity, in order to achieve the desired state of consciousness. The aim of kriya yoga is to realize the ultimate reality through the combined practice of tap, self-study, and surrender to the Lord."""
2,2,"""The guru explains that through the practice of kriya yoga, one's internal organs become pure and one's attachment to the worldly life diminishes. One's mind becomes illuminated and the ego dissolves. Through the practice of kriya yoga, one's five afflictions can be overcome. The guru explains that kriya yoga is the eternal practice of tapas, svadhyaya, and ishvara pranidhana. As one practices kriya yoga, one's intellect becomes subdued and one's ego begins to dissolve. One's heart becomes pure and one's attachment to worldly life diminishes. Through kriya yoga, one can overcome the three types of afflictions: raga, dvesha, and abhinivesha. The guru emphasizes the importance of consistent practice and detachment for success on the path of yoga. He advises that one should engage in constant practice and detachment, and that the fruits of kriya yoga will be the realization of one's true self. He also warns that without consistent practice and detachment, one will remain stuck in the middle of the path."""
2,3,"""In the previous sutras, a new word emerged, which led to a natural question: what are these klesh and how many are there? Maharsi answers this inquiry by naming the five kleshas. They are: avidya, asmita, raga, dwesha, and abhinivesha. The intention of maharsi Vyasa in his yoga darshan commentary is that these five kleshas are five kinds of misperception. These five kleshas increase a person's unrighteous tendency and manifest it. Thus, a person gets entangled in the cycle of birth and death, getting stuck in the cycle of karma and reaction. As long as these five kleshas are present at the root of every tendency or action, a person cannot be liberated from bondage. As long as avidya and other kleshas are present at the root, a person cannot engage in righteous conduct. Liberation cannot be achieved. The aspirant cannot attain their true nature. Therefore, Maharsi has only mentioned the names of the five kleshas in this sutra. In later sutras, the details of the nature and activities of these five kleshas will be discussed."""
2,4,"""The teaching of the five great mistakes starts with the first mistake, which is Avyakta or ignorance. Here, maharishi will explain the concept of ignorance and its role in causing all the other four mistakes. The savior's work is to cultivate the state of samadhi through the practice of yoga and to weaken the seeds of the five great mistakes. For this, it is essential to understand the nature of the five great mistakes.

Avidya is the primary and most important point that everything originates from it, and it is the mother of all the mistakes. The cause of all the mistakes is ignorance, and Asmita, Raga, Dwesh, Abhinivesha are its effects. According to the text, the five-stage development of the great mistakes is as follows: Prasupta, which is the seed stage; Udara, which is the grown-up stage; Vichinna, which is the separating stage; Samadhi, which is the state of union; and Niralamba, which is the state of detachment.

The text further elaborates that when the seeds of the great mistakes are not yet manifest, they are in a dormant state. However, if the suitable environment arises, they can start to manifest, and the person will experience the consequences of their actions. The text also emphasizes the importance of self-realization and meditation in understanding the true nature of the self.

The text concludes by saying that it is essential to recognize the seeds of the great mistakes and to take steps to eliminate them. It recommends the practice of Pratipaksha Bhavana, which involves cultivating positive thoughts and emotions to counterbalance the negative ones, and eventually attaining the state of Samadhi, where the seeds of the great mistakes are completely eliminated."""
2,5,"Before, we defined ignorance as a small definition, that it is the mother of all kleshas, the causal or fundamental ground. Now, we will discuss the nature of ignorance. Seeing eternity in impermanent things, purity in impure things, taking suffering as happiness, and considering inanimate things as conscious beings - this is the primary characteristic of ignorance. How do we see the eternal in the impermanent? - Nature is trigunatantra, the outcome is impermanent, but all natural elements are separate from the conscious entity and are always present. 

The body made of these primordial elements also considers itself eternal and is deeply ignorant. If one considers the body to be impermanent and does not act in accordance, they will be overwhelmed by extreme ignorance. If one considers the body to be eternal, they will be still more deeply immersed in ignorance. 

To the extent that we are associated with impermanent things in daily life and behave with them as if they were eternal, it is also considered ignorance. In reality, the first and foremost root of all types of ignorance is considering the body to be eternal. As soon as we consider the body to be eternal, we start behaving as if the self, the object, the place, and the relationship are eternal too, and we get completely absorbed in ignorance. 

This is bondage and becomes more rigid and painful. Similarly, ignorance arises when we see eternity in impermanent things and purity in impure things. 

We should understand that ignorance has three main forms: taking suffering as happiness, considering the body to be pure and beautiful, and considering the self in the primordial elements. 

Suffering is considered happiness by the world, but in reality, it is suffering. Therefore, the disciple should practice renouncing both pleasure and pain. 

The fourth form of ignorance is seeing the self in the primordial elements and considering the body as the self. Not being able to distinguish between the conscious and unconscious principles is also ignorance. 

We cannot start our yoga journey without understanding the nature of the world and the individual. We will realize the true nature of the world and the individual through accumulation of experiences and practice, and then we will attain the highest knowledge."
2,6,"""There are two types of power in our body. One is the power of perception, i.e., the seeing ego, and the other is the power of insight, i.e., the intelligence that sees. When we do not see the distinction between these two powers, we consider the unity of these two as self-nature, and identify it as ego-clash. There is a natural distinction between the two fundamental principles, their attributes, and their nature, but due to ignorance, we do not understand the distinction between consciousness and inert objects and identify them as one. As a result, we see a confused, mixed form of the person, making it impossible to see the distinction between them without yoga. This is said to be the power of the divine Maya. The individual consciousness is the eternal principle, while intellect is a product of the natural process and the first manifestation of the material world. The individual consciousness is unmanifest, while intellect is manifest. The individual has the power of perception, but intellect is only the means by which it manifests. Without the practice of Ashtanga Yoga and Kriya Yoga, a person is under the control of Maya and does not recognize the distinction between the two, identifies them as one, and accumulates the impressions of suffering. It is only when man realizes the distinct nature of the two powers, the individual and intellect, that he gains true knowledge. We have learned what ego-clash is. We can destroy all these ego-clashes through Kriya Yoga (tapas, self-study, and worship of God) and then achieve self-realization through Ashtanga Yoga and samadhi."""
2,7,"Ignorance, asmita, two types of sufferings, are comprehensively understood after which rage, the third suffering, is found in the manifestation of it in each human being. When we experience any pleasure, we are driven to re-experience the same pleasure through the same means that brought us the initial pleasure, which is called rage in yoga. Although everyone enjoys pleasure, the suffering that arises from pleasure is not equal to the suffering that arises from the pleasure followed by rage, which hampers our life throughout. Therefore, saints and sages renounce the world to abandon these two sufferings, rage and hatred. These two sufferings keep us trapped in our daily life, and it is only by escaping from them that we can progress on the path of yoga. 

Rage arises from the desire to experience pleasure. For example, if you have tasted a sweet and been pleased with it, the memory of the sweet will remain in your mind, and when you get another opportunity to taste it, you will be driven to do so. If you cannot procure it easily, you may become restless and anxious. This is all due to rage. 

If someone obstructs you from getting the sweet, hatred will arise immediately. This hatred will spread to everything related to the sweet, and you will start hating everyone and everything associated with it. In the same way, hate and rage will start dominating your life, leading to conflicts, disturbances, and turmoil. Similarly, when we experience pleasure through the senses, we should understand that it can lead to the same kind of suffering."
2,8,"""It is also well-known that everyone's life is beset by different sorrows, and that the experience of these sorrows gets imprinted in the mind as a habit. This sorrow turns into a habit that is difficult to overcome, and it creates various obstacles, including mental and physical anger, violence, jealousy, and the like. If this habit of sorrow grows stronger, it creates a constant state of uncertainty, and the person becomes unable to trust anyone. If a person lives in this state of uncertainty, he becomes detached from his own self. He is reduced to just a physical body, losing touch with his true nature, which is his soul. This state is extremely perilous.

This habit of sorrow breeds constant negativity, and a person becomes irritable and complaining by nature. When someone is consumed by sorrow, they start thinking, 'Why did this sorrow come my way? What were the reasons behind it?' This experience gets imprinted in their mind as a habit, and it becomes a memory that is triggered by any adverse situation. This memory gives rise to hatred.

Hatred and attachment are two opposing forms of suffering, but they have a similar process of formation. Hatred separates a person from others and makes them inclined towards sin and violence, leading them down a path of bad karma that affects their entire life, birth after birth. Therefore, one should understand and utilize both attachment and hatred in the right way, solely for the upliftment of one's own life.

It is true that hatred is a form of suffering, but it also has a power within it. This power can help us overcome our shortcomings and vices. Therefore, if we use this power to rid ourselves of our flaws and weaknesses, it becomes a sattvic power. God has given us a choice - whether to use this power for good or to get consumed by it and destroy ourselves. The king of life is knowledge; know this and live accordingly."""
2,9,"Every individual has a fear within them, which is the fear of death. This is known as the ""fear of death"" or "" fear of demise"". This fear is not limited to ordinary humans, but even scholars who know about the self, the supreme self, and nature as per scriptures, and are aware of the principles and laws of yoga, but have not fully experienced the bliss of liberation and are still practicing for spiritual freedom, are also affected by this fear. This fear is present in the minds of ordinary humans and scholars at a subtle level. 

A question arises as to how someone who has not experienced death can have a fear of death. If someone has experienced death in some way but is still alive, then it is natural to have a fear of death. However, such events do not occur in everyone's life, and even if they did, it would be impossible. Therefore, it is a mystery why everyone, from the moment of birth, has a seed of fear of death in their mind, which is carried over from past lives. 

This is true that every living being has this fear. It means that this fear has been imprinted in our subconscious from the past lives, not from this life, when we died. This fear is the evidence of the existence of past lives, and also proves that the soul is eternal. 

This fear is always present in a subtle form, and some people are extremely affected by it because their subconscious mind is open to it. Those who take refuge in the sadhana of tap, swadhyaya, and ishwar pranidhan and move forward in life are eventually liberated from the fear of death. When a yogi experiences the ultimate truth, he is not affected by the fear of his own death, nor is he troubled by the death of any living being."
2,10,"In the previous sutras from number 3 to 9, Sage Patanjali has explained in detail the nature and working of the five Kleśas. After understanding them well, the disciples felt that these Kleśas are very dangerous, and their causes have made the entire life chaotic. All fetters and sorrows have their origin here too, so how can their complete annihilation be possible? Can the practice of Kriyāyoga alone eliminate them, or is there another method? To answer this, Sage Patanjali says that these five Kleśas, including avidyā, are extremely subtle. They are born of the same nature as the mind, and it is natural for them to merge into that same nature. In yoga practice, the obstacle-creating factors need to be brought under control, and the factors conducive to samādhi need to be manifest. It is essential for the seeker to understand which negative qualities will merge into their causes and which positive qualities or emotions will manifest because of what. Nothing is destroyed in the yogic path, it only merges. What originates from something else merges into that same thing, and that is what is meant by 'destruction.' Therefore, one needs to look upon one's own negative qualities, vices, bad habits, and bad tendencies as mere obstacles that need to be overcome by bringing them under control, and cultivate the opposite virtues, good habits, and noble tendencies. By adopting this thinking and perspective, the seeker begins to move forward on the yogic path. As soon as the five Kleśas merge into nature along with the mind, the yoga practitioner becomes pure and attains the state of samādhi. Being in the company of Ishvara, they abide in eternal bliss and live a life of liberation. They live in a state of resolution, living life free from karma."
2,11,"When conflicts are weakened through Kriya Yoga, meaning their gross manifestations are transformed into subtle forms through Kriya Yoga, then it is necessary to attempt to burn them away through meditation. When conflicts manifest in a large or intense form, they are referred to as their gross form. To remove them, one must take recourse to Kriya Yoga. Through Kriya Yoga, one can only make them subtle, but to almost completely eliminate them, a sincere effort is required, which is referred to as meditation by Maharshi. Here, meditation means discriminative awareness. Just as true knowledge arises from unshakeable awareness, similarly, I must strive to eliminate the subtle forms of my conflicts through such unshakeable awareness, and through this flow of unshakeable awareness, make a huge effort to eliminate them. Yoga Darshan is a systematic scripture. Here, one learns about the systematic way of knowing the true nature, the definite process, the definite goal, the problem, and the solution. Therefore, if Maharshi says that subtle conflicts can be eliminated through meditation or discriminative awareness, this is 100% true. Any aspirant who practices regular meditation will definitely find that the results described in the Yoga Sutras come about through them. Yoga Darshan is the scripture of practice, and without practice, there is no progress. Therefore, whoever aspires to practice Yoga Sutras in their life must bring the already formulated methods into practice. When our conflicts become subtle through Kriya Yoga, then the aspirant should constantly examine each action, behavior, and endeavor, and see if even a slightest trace of conflict exists. If it does, one should continue to make an effort to distance oneself from it. In this way, as continuous blows of knowledge are struck, there will come a day when one will gain complete control over one's conflicts."
2,12,"""Those who have ignorance and other five afflictions as the root of their actions, their actions bring fruit in the form of pleasure or pain in their present and future lives. One significant implication of this is that actions that do not have ignorance and other five afflictions as their roots do not manifest their fruits. Such actions are called selfless actions, which only Yogis follow. Worldly people's actions are categorized into three types. The actions that are done in this world against the principles of Yoga are rooted in afflictions and bring pleasure or pain. But due to being rooted in afflictions, they also entangle us in various bonds or bring suffering. Desire, anger, attachment, and spiritual ignorance are the root causes of all wholesome or unwholesome actions, and their intensity or moderation determine whether we experience happiness or suffering in this life or the next. Actions with a very strong force bring their fruits quickly, either in this life or the next. However, if someone commits very bad actions, their fruits may not manifest in this life, but in future lives or births. This is because every affliction-based action is prone to be experienced in three ways. If a person commits such a bad action that its fruit cannot be experienced in human birth, it may be experienced in an animal or bird birth instead. Similarly, in human birth, the perpetrator of a very bad action may have to wait for a more suitable birth before experiencing the fruit. In this world, many times, criminals who have committed very bad actions are punished with imprisonment for two to three lifetimes. However, in reality, the punishment could be given in just one lifetime. But in the kingdom of God, the punishment system works in such a way that even if the punishment cannot be given in human form, the fruit of bad actions will still be experienced. If the punishment is written in the form of a dog's birth, it will be awaited and, when the time comes, the person will be taken to the dog's birth as the punishment. This is why it is said: God's house may take time, but it will never be dark. This is a spiritual science of actions and their fruits."""
2,13,"Sages explain in this sutra that if the foundation of karma is suffering, then our habits will be imprinted in our mind, and as a result, we will experience the fruit of our actions in the form of caste, age, and pleasure. The question now arises: what are these caste, age, and pleasure? Caste here does not refer to the social castes like Brahmin, Yadav, Ahir, or other social groups, but rather it is a term used in yoga. In yoga, whenever the term ""caste"" is used, it should be understood as referring to the classification of various beings into categories based on their characteristics. When karma ripens to give its fruit, it does so in three forms: caste, age, and pleasure. Any action that is associated with suffering will give its fruit in one of these three forms either in human or animal or insect forms. 

Age: the age of every being is fixed according to its caste. If a being is born in human caste, it will have an age of approximately 100 years or, according to the actions, a fixed age (which may be more or less). Similarly, the age of animals and insects should also be understood according to their caste. 

Pleasure: the third thing that we get as the fruit of our actions is pleasure or the means to experience pleasure or pain. For example, according to the actions, the amount of pleasure or pain is also fixed. Those actions through which suffering is experienced will continue to suffer, and those through which pleasure is experienced will continue to enjoy. 

In addition to this, the present life is influenced by the actions that are being performed in that life, and the fruit that is experienced (in the form of pleasure and pain) is also determined by caste. It is essential to understand that humans are the only beings where the imprints of past karma can cause pleasure and pain, and new karma also arises due to these imprints. 

Different beings, excluding humans, are only pleasure bodies, which experience the fruit of past karma and then escape from that body. The main reason for this is that humans have the freedom to perform new actions, whereas pleasure bodies do not create new karma, but only experience the fruit of past karma."
2,14,"""The fruits of past karma bring forth respectively the species, age, and enjoyment, joy, and sorrow. Because every karma is caused by noble deeds or good karma, karma born of virtue brings happiness and karma born of vice brings sorrow. The venerable sage is clearly stating here that the causes of virtue and vice in karma lead to fruits that are respectively of happiness and sorrow. Whatever we do, its fruit is certainly formed in the form of karma. Therefore, we should strive to make our karma virtuous. As we gradually proceed on the path of sadhana, our karma can also transform into selfless karma. It is said in the Gita that no human being in this world can exist even for a moment without doing karma. Therefore, doing karma is a necessity, and then the pure intellect advises us to do good karma. Such karma is that in which we experience self-satisfaction while doing it and which does not harm others. With this consciousness, when we take a step in the field of karma, we will be able to do selfless karma. The concept of karma is so profound that even after deep contemplation, it does not become clear. Even great thinkers and scholars who are versed in philosophy and are capable of discerning the truth cannot fully comprehend the nature of karma. Therefore, in the beginning, even if one does not fully understand, it is necessary to try to do a good karma, thinking thus and doing good karma."""
2,15,"In this world, everything is constructed. The behavior of the world is contradictory to its nature. There is both goodness and badness here. There are both good and bad tendencies. There are opportunities to do virtuous deeds, as well as opportunities to do sinful deeds. Summarized, everything is available here. It now depends on human nature as to what choice one makes, and God has made humans independent agents, granting them the power to make choices in every situation. He has also given them the power to choose through compassion. Through the Vedas, Upanishads, Darshanas, and Geetas, Raghunathas and Mahabharatas, etc., many sacred texts have been available to determine what is right and wrong. However, he has still granted them the full power of choice. When one has full power of choice, it is certain that one is doing what one wants to do. As one is doing what one wants to do, one is then making choices to do what one wants to do. If one is doing something under pressure, one is then making the choice under pressure and performing the act. In reality, each person is the chooser and the receiver of karma. When one's age, social status, and possessions bring both happiness and sorrow to a person, people experience happiness and sorrow simultaneously. The yogi, on the other hand, considers all happiness and sorrow to be sorrowful. When someone experiences happiness, the yogi sees sorrow; and when someone experiences sorrow, the yogi sees it as a means to attain enlightenment.

Karma is what brings its consequences to a person, and the yogi is free from the consequences of karma. The yogi sees all happiness as sorrow, as all happiness is ultimately sorrow. This is the great spiritual science. All can understand that happiness is not happiness; it is sorrow. The yogi, by considering all happiness and sorrow to be sorrow, becomes detached from both. When one experiences happiness, one does not consider it happiness; one looks at it as a means to attain detachment. And when one experiences sorrow, one does not consider it sorrow; one looks at it as a means to attain detachment.

The yogi, by cultivating detachment, ultimately attains the state of eternal beatitude, which is beyond happiness and sorrow. This is the ultimate goal of yoga."
2,16,"Even when we are happy, we can see the flaws of suffering. The great sage begins to tell us that we should not consider sufferings as sufferings and ask how we can escape them. If we have already experienced suffering in the form of karma, we cannot remove it. Similarly, if we are experiencing suffering in the present, we cannot remove it because karma is already in motion. Only the sufferings that will bear fruit in the future can be removed. The efforts to remove these future sufferings can be made. Just as in the past, we had freedom to choose our actions and execute them, so too we have the freedom to make new choices and take action. If we are experiencing suffering in the present, we cannot remove it because it has already occurred or is occurring in this moment. If we try to remove it, we will be stuck in time and unable to escape the present suffering. Therefore, the efforts we make to escape suffering will actually help in removing future suffering. This is why the sage has said that only future suffering is removable, not present or past suffering.

Like a mountain and its various streams coming together to form a river, a great calamity can occur. But if a dam is built, the excess water can be controlled, and the damage can be prevented. Similarly, if we prepare for the future and engage in strong and virtuous actions, we can prevent or reduce future suffering."
2,17,"Pain has been referred to as He in the context of yoga. Before this, the sages said to leave off the future sufferings. Two questions arise here - what is the cause of this pain, and how can it be alleviated. Therefore, the sages are describing the cause of pain as the union of the seer and the seen. The seer says the embodied self is situated in the body, and the seen refers to the attributes and the intellect, etc. arising from the attributes of nature. The union of the purusha or the embodied self and prakriti is the main cause of pain. People in the world are worried about their own pains and try to alleviate them in their own respective ways. Sometimes they get temporary relief, and sometimes not. However, if one looks at the main cause of pain, the ignorance-based union of the purusha and prakriti is the main cause that appears. One thing that needs to be understood is that all suffering is due to the appreciation of this gross body. The body is divided into three parts from the perspective of classification. The gross body, the subtle body, and the causal body. The gross body is this puppet-like body of flesh, blood, and organs. The subtle body is the intellect, ego, the 10 senses, the mind, and the five gross elements. When the self is connected to the subtle body, it is born again in a new body after death. When the self is united with the subtle body, it acquires the impressions of past lives and again enters the gross body. The body is the foundation of all pleasures and pains, and the union of the self and the subtle body is the cause of this. Therefore, when one wants to remove pain completely, one would have to remove the union with the body as well. In such a way, we find that the union of the self with nature, arising from ignorance, has become stuck. As long as this is not severed, one cannot become completely free from pain. We have been getting this body image for thousands and millions of times, and every time we have tried to get out of it. But being controlled by desires, we get caught up in worldly life and think that there is no need for liberation. We think we will continue to live in the world and spread love. In this way, we escape from one pain to another. But God knows that if the"
2,18,"""After explaining the form of sorrow and its causes as well as the ignorance-mediated conjunction of the seer and the seen, we are now discussing the form of the seen in the light of this sutra. Next, we will discuss the seen and the seer in detail. The seen is that which is radiant, active, and stationary, having the form of the elements and sense organs and fulfilling the purposes of enjoyment and liberation of the individual soul. It can also be referred to as nature. In simple terms, the seen is the combination of sattva (radiant), rajas (active), and tamas (stationary) and the five gross elements and the ten senses. This seen does not serve no purpose, but rather, it exists to fulfill the purposes of the jiva, that is, to achieve enjoyment and liberation. The seen is a means for the purush and is also a means for yogis and worldly people. It serves the purposes of worldly people for enjoyment and also serves to liberate those who want to be liberated. Therefore, it is capable of fulfilling the purposes of both types of people. This sutra has accurately described the form of the seen. A sadhak (one who is aspiring to attain self-realization) should strive to understand the forms of the seer and the seen clearly so that he may clearly determine his own purpose and also know the means by which liberation can be attained, so that he may use it correctly."""
2,19,"""Presents here, Maharsi is detailing different divisions of Drishya. What kind of gross elements come under Drishya, is being explained in different forms. Specifically, the Yogic names given are Five sensory organs, Five motor organs, Mind, and the Five grossest elements. Unspecifically, the names given are Five tanmatras and Ahankar. Lingamatra: the name given is that of importance or intelligence. Aling: the name given is that of the balanced state of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. Thus, division of Drishya into Specific, Unspecific, Lingamatra, and Aling. Some divisions are being explained for the sake of knowledge. The Five grossest elements: Akasha (space), Vayu (air), Agni (fire), Jal (water), Prithvi (earth). The Five tanmatras: Shabda (sound), Sparsha (touch), Rupa (form), Rasa (taste), Gandha (smell). The Five sensory organs: Shrout (ears), Tvak (skin), Chakshu (eyes), Jihva (tongue), Ghraana (nose). The Five motor organs: Vak (speech), Pantha (hands), Pada (feet), Payu (anus), Upasth (organs of excretion)."""
2,20,"""The words 'drista' and 'drishya' appeared in serial number 17. After explaining the word 'drishya' in detail, now I will talk about Maharshi Drista. Earlier, I had explained in simple words that all insentient objects (nature, mind, intellect, ego, senses, etc.) are referred to as 'drishya', while the conscious principle (soul, self) is referred to as 'drista' in yoga. Maharshi defines 'drista' as the pure and wisdom-based individual (the seer) who sees as per the tendencies that arise in the mind, even if he is always pure, enlightened, and free. In other words, the person or the self sees according to the thoughts or tendencies that arise in the mind. The mind shows what the self will see. The self does not choose to see itself, but rather its mind, through the association with the senses and intellect, acquires knowledge and sees accordingly. That is why it is said that to attain the pure form of the self, which is eternal, it is extremely necessary to purify the mind, intellect, and senses first, for if they remain impure, even after being pure, the self will still acquire impurities. This has been said in many scriptures, including the Samkhya philosophy, that the self is pure and unchanging, but it is the impure mind that binds the self with impurities. Everything else in this body is a means or instrument. Therefore, what the senses will show is what reaches the self. Through this entire process, the self can inspire purification of the mind, intellect, and ego."""
2,21,"""In the present sutra, Maharshi is again saying something about the purpose of nature. The formless and formful aspects of nature are meant to be experienced and enjoyed by the self, leading to liberation (moksha) and ultimate ecstasy (kaivalya). Maharshi has said this twice, and the significance is that he wants to stress this point strongly. In profound texts like the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, no word is redundant and they convey a deep meaning. 

In any text, there are four reasons behind writing: to set forth the scope, to discuss the subject, to state the purpose, and to establish a relationship. The reason behind repeating the same thing in different ways is to ensure that the reader understands it well. 

The entire form and all its limbs are meant to be fulfilled for the benefit of the self, leading to the attainment of ultimate reality. This is the subtle hint given by Maharshi for us all. 

We had previously mentioned that one cannot pluck a thorn from another thorn, and even the thorn that was plucked would be discarded later. When you place this example before yourself, you will gain a deep understanding of the path of Yoga. 

The main purpose of nature is to grant liberation (moksha) to the self, and enjoyment is secondary. Just as one uses a vehicle to reach a destination and in between the comforts and conveniences of the journey are mere means, similarly, the journey of enjoyment is just a means to reach the destination of liberation. 

If one is stuck in the comforts and conveniences of enjoyment, even after reaching the destination, one would not renounce the means and would be stuck in the cycle of birth and death, which is the greatest misfortune. 

Principle: The ultimate objective of nature is to grant enjoyment and liberation to the self. Nature has been created not for its own sake, but for the sake of the individual self. Nature is inanimate, and inanimate objects are useful only to conscious beings. Nature is a combination of inanimate objects, and therefore, it is always for the sake of others. That is, the combination of inanimate objects that occurs is for the sake of the enjoyment or liberation of some conscious entity. 

The self, or the individual self, cannot enjoy or attain liberation without the cooperation of nature."""
2,22,"For the yogi who has achieved Self-realization and has attained liberation, the universe comes to an end for them. However, for the ignorant, the unenlightened, and those who are still on the path of yoga, the universe does not come to an end. The universe is not created for any individual, but for humanity as a whole. Therefore, for those who have not yet attained liberation and who are still on the path of yoga, the universe will continue to exist in its true form, presenting various types of experiences and opportunities to them. Depending on their past karma, their social status, age, and experiences, the universe will provide them with the respective experiences and opportunities. For example, if a student passes the 10th class examination, that class no longer exists for them. However, the class continues to exist for others who have not passed the examination yet. They can choose to leave the class, but when they start studying again, they will start from the same class. All rules, laws, and systems will remain the same as before. Similarly, for those who are not yet liberated, the universe continues to exist in the same way as before, presenting them with various experiences and opportunities. Principle: The universe exists for everyone's experience and liberation, not just for an individual's liberation. An individual's liberation does not lead to the liberation of all. With an individual's liberation, the universe does not come to an end for others who are still striving for liberation. It is clear that an individual's liberation does not lead to the liberation of all. Therefore, the jiva (individual soul) is not one, but many."
2,23,"""Discussions on the nature of prakriti and purush have been carried out separately. Now, Maharshi is defining the union of these two. Earlier, Maharshi had mentioned that the union of the visible and the seer, which is bereft of ignorance, is the root cause of all suffering. However, through this formula, the true definition of union is being outlined. The union of prakriti and purush (jeevatma) is the cause of the attainment of their true nature. This union is helpful for distinguishing between the intellect and the self. As long as the union is not established between prakriti and purush, the opportunity to know this union will not arise, and a human being will not be able to know himself and prakriti. In this sense, this union is the root cause. The word 'sw' here refers to prakriti, and 'swami' refers to jeevatma. The self is called swami, indicating that jeevatma can control sw-kaushalya. Therefore, it is necessary to use sw-kaushalya in control to achieve the attainment of mukti through the enjoyment of life. Principle: Without the union, there is no opportunity to know prakriti or the true nature of purush. The union of prakriti and purush (mutual union) is the root cause of all kinds of suffering. If life is seen as only two powers, it is the sw-kaushalya and swami-kaushalya."""
2,24,"""The union of nature and spirit is due to avidya. Maharshi has clearly stated the principle of union. The beauty of Yoga philosophy lies in the direct discussion of cause and effect. Therefore, understanding the subject and working on it becomes extremely easy. When the word avidya is used in the Yoga Sutras, its direct meaning is maya or the root cause of the origin of the five afflictions. According to the Vyasa commentary, avidya is referred to as ""the craving for false knowledge"". As long as there is the flow of inverted knowledge in the mind, there is no real knowledge. Hence, the union of nature and spirit is maintained. It is due to avidya that the meeting of nature and spirit takes place and then a world begins. The entire transaction or cycle of the intellect, mind, and ego begins. All the possibilities of enjoyment and liberation begin for the individual. The nature of avidya is explained in the fourth and fifth sutras of this pad. This ignorance cannot be destroyed without true knowledge. Without true knowledge, intellect does not acquire discrimination, and discrimination is the special means by which ignorance is ended, and the yogi comes to see the separate forms of nature and spirit. Principle: The cause of the union of nature and spirit is ignorance or avidya. The end of ignorance cannot be achieved without true knowledge. It is due to avidya that the individual becomes conscious of the rising tendencies in the mind and experiences himself as a tendency."""
2,25,"""We are explaining the absence of union due to ignorance in the context of the union mentioned above. This absence of union is known as 'haan' in yoga and 'kaivalya' in the context of the purusa. We have been continuously understanding the concept of duality and their union through previous sutras, and we are arriving at a certainty that this world is causing us immense suffering. Therefore, please try to understand this presentation thoroughly, as it will reveal the path of complete liberation from suffering. The purusa is a separate conscious existence, and nature is a separate and distinct existence. Due to mithya-jnana, both are in a state of opposition. As a result, the eternal, pure, and free self is entangled with ego and desires and becomes entangled with the joys and sorrows of the world. It also begins to consider itself the doer and enjoyer. Anger, attachment, desire, and infatuation are rising in me as a stiffly held belief. This is all happening due to the union of the pure self and the impure nature. If one wants to cut off this union, the only way is to attain true knowledge. True knowledge is the knowledge of the eternal in the eternal and the impermanent in the impermanent, which is pure and which is impure. One should consider the pure as pure and the impure as impure. One should consider oneself as the self and not consider others as the self. This is the highest goal of realizing the self. This state is known as kaivalya, freedom, or liberation. When the purusa and nature are in their own distinct forms and no longer bound, this state is known as 'haan'. Liberation from suffering is known as 'haan' for the purusa. Hitherto, the concepts of 'haan' have been explained, and it has been established that the purusa and nature cannot unite unless their union is cut off."""
2,26,"Before, it was described in a previous sutra that if the fruition of coincidence ends, all sorrows will be eradicated. And in the language of yoga, this state is called haan. This haan is also referred to as the liberation or salvation of the self. Now, the question arises as to what is the main reason for achieving this state of haan. What is the method for attaining it? The great sage says that the primary causes of haan are the realization of the distinction between prakriti and purush, and the development of a sturdy and mature understanding (viveka-khyati). When the self has this understanding, it ceases to forget even for a moment the truth of its own nature. At that time, the understanding becomes profound.

In the yoga philosophy, this understanding is referred to as viveka-khyati. It is the means by which haan is achieved. We may have general knowledge that the causes of our sorrows are the union of purush and prakriti, and that the cause of this union is avidya. If avidya is removed, the union will also cease, and a state of haan will arise. And this state is salvation for the self.

Furthermore, the means to achieve haan is the stability of this understanding, which will lead to the emergence of viveka-khyati within us, and we will be freed from the burdens of the body. However, this is not a mundane knowledge. This knowledge is non-dual, because it is yet to be partaken by the self. It is a mere understanding. As long as this understanding is not deeply ingrained in us, and as long as our understanding is not stable, it will remain a mere direction, and we will have to continue our journey of yoga.

Therefore, the great sage says that the means to achieve haan is the unbroken realization, experience, stability, and maturity of the understanding of the distinction between prakriti and purush. Only then will we attain the perfection of our true form, and all will be resolved."
2,27,"As soon as the yogi achieves the state of wisdom, that is, the state of immutable and unbroken knowledge, then a special sort of intuition arrives in his intellect. His intellect becomes extraordinary. Previously, it was attached to worldly pursuits and ignorance, but now it is drawn only towards the truth. Maharshi has described it as the intuition of the clear-sighted one. In this way, the yogi comes to possess seven stages of intelligence. Let us understand what these seven stages of intelligence are: whatever has been abandoned is no longer worthy of being abandoned, and what has been attained is no longer to be attained. Every stain has been washed away, and there is no more sorrow to be ended. The first stage of intellect is thus established.

All the troubles that had to be abandoned have been abandoned, and there is no more abandoning to be done. All that had to be known has been known, and there is nothing more to be known. This is the second stage of intellect.

The sorrow that had to be ended has been ended, and there is no more ending to be done. This is the third stage of intellect.

The wisdom that has been achieved is unshakeable and has become the fourth stage of intellect.

The intellect has reached its final stage, and there is no more work to be done. This is the fifth stage of intellect.

The three gunas have been absorbed into their respective causes and are no longer born again. Such is the intuition that is the sixth stage of intellect.

Like a stone breaking off from the mountain and rolling down into the valley, the three gunas become absorbed in their causes and never return to the yogi's mind. This is the realization of the guna-trevishest. The Self, having become guna-trevishest, settles into its true and unblemished form. Then the Self alone shines, pure and unblemished, in its own true form. This is the seventh and highest stage of intellect. When a yogi's intellect has experienced the seven stages of intuition and the Self has been freed from its affinity with the gunas, then it is said to have attained perfect self-realization."
2,28,"The sage explained the process of self-realization from the first principle to the 27th. He understood the vast process of taking human beings from the bondage of birth and death to the state of kaivalya. He explained how humans are caught in the cycle of birth and death due to the ignorance of their true nature. They experience suffering in the world and try to escape from it. He differentiated between the nature of the self and the intellect. He also explained the process of removing the ignorance that binds the individual to the cycle of birth and death. Finally, he explained that one cannot attain complete liberation from suffering until one reaches the state of viveka or discriminative knowledge.

The sage also emphasized the importance of practicing kriya yoga for removing the obstacles that hinder the path to self-realization. He said that those who want to progress on the path of yoga should first practice moral disciplines and self-inquiry. Only then can they progress to the practice of ashtanga yoga.

The practice of yoga consists of eight limbs, and the abandonment of all impurities and the manifestation of pure knowledge are the culmination of this process. The process of obtaining pure knowledge is called viveka or discriminative knowledge, and it can only be attained by the removal of all impurities and the constant practice of yoga.

There are two types of yoga: worldly yoga and spiritual yoga. When both types are practiced simultaneously, the individual's past impressions are eliminated and new impressions are not formed. The results of karma do not accumulate, and the individual is liberated from the cycle of birth and death. Ultimately, the individual achieves total liberation and pure knowledge."
2,29,"""This verse is defining Astanga Yoga through its medium. I call it the soul of Yogasutras. This verse is the center of all verses. The sutras coming in Astanga Yoga are all nuclear sutras of Yoga philosophy. They are the ones that determine the path of practice and bestow all glories, powers, and celestial experiences. All celestial experiences possible in the spiritual realm can be obtained through the practice of Astanga Yoga. The eight limbs of Yoga are: Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratihara, Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi. One important word in this verse is 'anushthana'. Its meaning is the practice of a specific ritual. When performed with single-minded effort and attention, it is called anushthana. Therefore, the meaning of the verse is that by performing the rituals of Yama, Niyama, etc. with continuous effort, all impurities are destroyed and one arrives at the state of higher knowledge. Hence, a seeker should practice these eight limbs of Yoga in a systematic manner, destroy the bond between nature and the individual, and obtain eternal bliss."""
2,30,"Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, and Aparigraha are the five Yamas. Let us understand them in detail and see how we can follow them in our own lives.

1. Ahimsa: Not to harbor ill will towards any living being, through thought, word, or action. This ahimsa should manifest in both thought and action. For example, we should not think or speak harmfully about others, nor should we physically harm them.

2. Satya: To express the truth, whether it is about a person, thing, or place, in the same manner as we have perceived, understood, and known it.

3. Asteya: Not to steal, in the sense of not taking something that belongs to someone else, either physically or metaphorically. It also means not coveting someone else's property or resources.

4. Brahmacharya: To lead a life like Brahman, in the sense of cultivating pure thoughts, words, and actions. It includes preserving one's vital energy, honoring God, offering prayers, and maintaining purity in relationships.

5. Aparigraha: Not to accumulate more resources than are necessary, and not to hoard things beyond what one needs."
2,31,"These five vows are also known as mahavrat. All these mahavrat are above jati, desh, kala, and time and are to be performed in every situation. Regardless of the situation, a sadhak should not give up these five vows. These are not ordinary vows, but mahavrat that should never be given up.

1. Above jati: In yoga philosophy, when the word jati is used, it should be understood as referring to any living being or creature. One should practice ahimsa not just towards humans, but towards all living beings. It is not okay to think that I am compassionate towards humans, but violent towards animals. One should practice ahimsa with every thought, speech, and action towards all living beings.

2. Above desh: In yoga philosophy, when the word desh is used, it should be understood as referring to any place or location. Just as ahimsa is beyond jati, it is also beyond desh. One should not consider any place as sacred and then commit violence elsewhere. One should practice ahimsa in every place and location.

3. Above kala: The word kala in this sutra refers to any time or date. It is not okay to think that I will practice ahimsa only on a special day or during a festival, but commit violence on other days. Ahimsa should be practiced at all times.

4. Above samay: In this sutra, time refers to a schedule or a rule. It is not okay to think that I will commit violence only according to a particular rule or schedule, but not at other times. Maharishis have gone beyond even this.

One should understand ahimsa as being above jati, desh, kala, and samay. In the same way, one can also understand the other yamas, such as satya, asteya, brahmacharya, and aparigraha."
2,32,"""The five ordinances are: purity, satisfaction, austerities, self-study, and association with God. After discussing the five yamas in detail, Maharsis continue to explain the next part of the yoga set of rules. The meaning of the rule is that those who follow these rules can make their daily life part of the yoga path. If there is irregularity in the practice of these rules, the yoga path becomes dull. Following the rules brings clarity within and outside. As it is well-known that wherever there is speed, there is certainly progress.

External purity and internal purity are the two divisions of the concept of purity. The body is susceptible to two types of impurities. The first is physical impurity, and the second is mental impurity. If the body is not internalized, the mind will also feel uneasy and impure. If mental purity is not achieved, its impact will also be felt on the body. Many modern scientists say that most diseases are psycho-somatic, meaning they arise from the relationship between the body and the mind.

Therefore, purification of both the body and the mind is the first rule. Physical purity means bathing the body naturally, using earth and water. In today's modern era, many soaps and detergents have taken the place of earth and water, but it is still possible to try to keep the body pure naturally.

On the other hand, internal purity means purifying the inner self through the practice of yoga, Ahimsa, and other yamas. Just as the body becomes foul if not cleaned, the inner self also becomes contaminated if not purified. Regular practice of self-purification is necessary to keep the body pure. It is almost impossible to achieve inner purity.

Satisfaction is the greatest joy after happiness in this world. It is the happiness of being content with whatever is received from God. It is the happiness of being grateful to God. Those who do not strive to utilize their full potential and achieve success will remain unsatisfied. Therefore, it is necessary to strive to achieve one's full potential and then be content with what is received. Failure to utilize one's potential will lead to unhappiness.

When we are practicing ahimsa, satya, and other yamas, the opposite feelings will arise. Then, how can we protect ourselves from vices or bad habits? Maharshi is explaining a special practice for this. When opposing feelings or thoughts come up while following the yamas and niyamas, it is necessary to cultivate opposite virtuous thoughts. The practice of yamas and niyamas is done in a state of awareness, and this state of awareness is the practice itself. For example, if a person has a tendency to violence or lying, one should immediately contemplate ahimsa and satya and make an effort to calm the mind. Similarly, one should understand and cultivate opposite virtues for other feelings too. If a practitioner enters the eight-fold path of Astanga Yoga with a steady mind, they can reduce these obstacles to a great extent. However, even then, obstacles will arise in the practice of yamas and niyamas, and it is necessary to cultivate feelings of compassion opposite to violence, truth opposite to falsehood, non-stealing, self-control, and generosity, and to distribute whatever is earned for the welfare of others, by taking it out from one's own life, and this is the practice of Pratipaksha Bhavana."""
2,34,"""Presentation of Sutrnam includes an explanation of harmful thoughts and their causes. Misinterpretations are divided into three types: 

1. Krit: This refers to thoughts and actions that violate the principles of dharma, such as harming others, speaking falsehoods, and thinking lustful thoughts. 

2. Karit: This refers to actions that are done by others, but are influenced by one's own thoughts and desires. For example, inciting someone to commit violence, speaking false words, and condoning immoral behavior.

3. Anumodit: This refers to actions that are done by others, but are supported and condoned by our own thoughts and desires.

These three types of misinterpretations are caused by three factors: greed, anger, and attachment.

1. Krit-Greed: When we are driven by greed, we are prone to commit harmful actions.

2. Karit-Greed: When we are influenced by greed, we may incite others to commit harm.

3. Anumodit-Greed: When we condone harmful actions, driven by greed, we are also responsible for those actions.

The same analysis applies to anger and attachment.

Each misinterpretation has three sub-types: 
Krit-L, Krit-K, Krit-M (caused by greed, anger, and attachment respectively)
Karit-L, Karit-K, Karit-M (caused by greed, anger, and attachment respectively)
Anumodit-L, Anumodit-K, Anumodit-M (caused by greed, anger, and attachment respectively)

In total, there are 27 sub-types of misinterpretations.

However, these 27 sub-types also have three further sub-types, making a total of 81 sub-types.

Each individual misinterpretation has many sub-types depending on the type, ranging from mild to severe.

In the same way, the principles of yama and niyama also have many sub-types, and each sub-type has many more sub-sub-types.

In this way, the principles of yama and niyama become complex and varied, with countless sub-types.

Therefore, one should strive to understand these principles carefully and avoid engaging in harmful behaviors.""

Note: Yama and niyama are concepts from Hinduism, referring to the principles of ethical conduct and moral rules."
2,35,"After discussing the principles of Yam and Niyam in detail, we will now discuss what kind of fruit they lead to. We will be discussing what benefits a yogi gets from following all 10 Yamas, and how they are beneficial for his physical and mental well-being. Ahimsa is considered the most important of all Yamas. Just as ignorance is the root cause of all misery, Ahimsa is the root cause of all Yamas. When a sadhak constantly practices Ahimsa in his thought, word, and deed, and establishes it in his life, he ends violence towards all living beings, and also ends the ill will, hatred, and violence towards him by all other living beings. It is not just that the sadhak is free from violence and ill will, but others also abandon their ill will and violence towards him.

Not just hurting or showing ill will towards others, but even having a thought of harming or ill will towards someone is considered mental Ahimsa. Not speaking harshly or badly to anyone is considered verbal Ahimsa. Not causing physical harm or pain to anyone is considered physical Ahimsa. When a yogi becomes established in Ahimsa, he becomes free from violence and ill will towards all, and also frees others from their violence and ill will.

You all must have heard the solution to this question. Just as we behave nicely with others, they also start behaving nicely with us. If you practice this rule in your life for a month and see the amazing results. As the impurities of hatred towards someone are erased from your mind, their life also fills with friendliness towards you, without any special effort. Just through your own practice, someone is drawn towards friendship with you. In this way, when a sadhak becomes pure in his thought, word, and deed towards all, his effect becomes widespread. Just as he becomes filled with the feeling of Ahimsa, he becomes ready to follow all the other yamas and niyams in the same way. That's why Ahimsa is said to be the root of all Yamas."
2,36,"""The present sutra describes the outcome of Maharshi Sati Siddhi. When a yogi becomes fully established in truth, whatever he says becomes actualized in the world. Vyas Bhhashya says that when a yogi's speech becomes realized, if he says, 'Be virtuous,' the person becomes virtuous, and if he says, 'Achieve heaven,' he actually achieves it. How does speech become realized or a yogi become established in truth? As the yogi's all obstacles decrease, his mind gradually becomes pure. The light of knowledge illuminates the realm of reason and awareness. The mother of the five obstacles is ignorance, so when ignorance is destroyed, knowledge arises simultaneously, and the yogi begins to see everything clearly. Meanwhile, his attachments and aversions also decrease, making him impartial. Only an impartial person can rely on truth. In society, people listen more to and respect the opinion of one who is impartial. Thus, a yogi whose ignorance has been destroyed, free from attachments and aversions, whatever he says with discernment, becomes actualized as truth. He does not just say things, but whatever he does also yields results, and all his actions are dependent on that. In society, many examples can be seen of how children's words can change adults' hearts, as children's words can cleanse their hearts instantly. Adults are not even mindful of how the children's words might serve their own interests. Yogis, too, become pure like children and, when they say something, it becomes actualized as truth."""
2,37,"Now, Maharsi Asteey defines what Asteey means - it is to take something that belongs to someone else without their permission. This includes theft, cheating, looting, and robbery. However, simply acting in a way that is not exploitative is not enough. One must also not have any thoughts of taking something that belongs to someone else. 

When a yogi controls his senses and does not engage in exploitative activities, he achieves the state of Asteey. As a result, he gets everything he needs, and he is surrounded by all kinds of prosperity and wealth. 

Maharsi says that a yogi who has achieved the state of Asteey gets all kinds of valuable things, including wealth, status, and position. 

To achieve this state, a yogi must have certain qualities, such as not being excessive in his desires, not being greedy, being honest, and being aware of his own limitations. 

If a yogi is not controlled by his own desires and needs, and if he does not engage in exploitative activities, he achieves the state of Asteey. At that point, he gets everything he needs, but he does not use it for personal gain. Instead, he uses it for the greater good. 

It is the will of God that one should only receive what one can give. A yogi whose mind is free from desires is someone who has space in his heart that can be filled."
2,38,"""Now, Maharshi is explaining the fruit of the vow of Brahmacharya. As we have explained earlier, the literal meaning of Brahmacharya is to follow the conduct of Brahma. The comprehensive meaning of Brahmacharya is to preserve one's vital energy and semen. As a result, a yogi attains unparalleled enthusiasm. His life is filled with an ever-new and increasing enthusiasm.

The interpretation of Brahmacharya varies slightly according to the division of varnashram. From 25 years to 50 years, the ashram is that of Brahmacharya, but from 25 to 50 years, the grihastha ashram permits the use of vital energy or semen for the purpose of progeny only.

In the third and fourth ashrams, i.e., vanaprastha and sanyasa ashrams, the practice of Brahmacharya is once again complete.

The relationships established in the grihastha ashram for the purpose of progeny or family growth are meaningful for achieving a specific goal and do not come under the purview of Brahmacharya. However, when one indulges in Brahmacharya solely for temporary pleasure, it becomes deserving of criticism, and is considered a waste of energy.

The significance of vital energy or semen is twofold: (1) to create progeny or increase the family lineage, and (2) to refine one's personality by retaining it within oneself. If vital energy or semen is wasted outside the body, it is an insult to one's vital energy and a denigration of the divine power given by God.

A yogi understands this properly and first gives attention to conserving vital energy and then practices it in his daily routine and life.

He thinks to himself: 'I should live like Brahma.' 'I am allowing Brahma to live through me.' 'If Brahma resides in my body and mind, how would I live?' 'I should live in that way.' 'I should not perform any deed that would make my God sad.'

In this way, a yogi is always enthusiastic and positive. He is not saddened or humiliated by anything. His enthusiasm increases as he continues to practice Brahmacharya.

It is a simple fact that when one destroys vital energy, he feels dejection and a lack of enthusiasm. This is the experience of everyone.

Therefore, when one conserves vital energy through the mind"
2,39,"""On attaining the state of aparigraha, one gets to know how to lead one's life in the present and in the future. When a yogi is engaged in the path of sadhana and practices Asthang Yoga, and gives up unnecessary thoughts, emotions, and belongings, then this state is called aparigraha. On achieving this state, the yogi gets to know exactly what happened in his past life and what is happening in his present life, and he also gets to know what can happen in the future. Everything becomes clear to him.

When a yogi's mind is not attached to thoughts nor to objects, then a natural flow of life sets in. In this flow, there are no impediments, only a natural flow. We have been living our lives since many past lives, and we have experienced them. But our memories and habits have been constricted, and many desires and cravings have arisen between them. We cannot even remember our past lives. However, when a yogi's attachment to unnecessary desires and possessions is forgotten, then he is able to recall all the significant events of his past life, not only that but also the events of his childhood in his present life. Thus, he gains knowledge of his past, present, and future.

It is only our desires and cravings that prevent us from recalling our memories. When we give up our attachment to these desires and cravings, then our life flow resumes, and we can recollect our old memories whenever we want. Therefore, on attaining the state of aparigraha, the yogi gains knowledge of his past, present, and future."""
2,40,"Now, Maharsi will tell us what fruit we get from following the first principle of purity, Shouch. Just as Ahimsa is the first principle mentioned in Yama, similarly, Shouch is the first principle mentioned in the Niyamas. As long as the seat of the soul, the body, is not clean from inside and outside, the process of sadhana cannot be started properly. 

A Yoga practitioner performs various yoga practices like Kriya Yoga before practicing Ashtanga Yoga to purify their five kleshic mental tendencies and to remove the dense ignorance that is the root cause of all suffering. 

One needs to have a clear understanding of the difference between the pure and impure. One needs to have a clear understanding of the difference between the pure and impure. 

This body of ours is the most intimate and closest to us, and it is covered with impurities both from outside and inside. Hence, first of all, one needs to understand the concept of purity and impurity. 

Once one has the understanding of purity and impurity, one can clean one's external and internal bodily impurities and thus one can develop the internal cleanliness, spiritual purification. 

This internal purification is achieved by removing the impurities from one's mind, which are kama, krodha, lobha, moha, irsha, dwesha, and chugla. This can be achieved by practicing sadhana and by replacing bad thoughts with good thoughts. 

Once one's internal and external bodily impurities are removed, one develops a dispassionate attitude towards one's own body and towards the bodies of others. 

Ultimately, one realizes that the body is just a tool and that there is no attachment or fascination with one's own body or with the bodies of others. 

Once one has this realization, one's worldly desires and attractions are eliminated, and one becomes free from many kinds of sufferings. 

But it's important to note that if one attaches oneself to one's own body or to the bodies of others, it will become a ground for bondage and suffering. 

As one practices purity and detachment, one's desires and attachments are eliminated, and one becomes free from many kinds of sufferings. 

It is important to note that if one practices any principle of yoga, be it Yama or Niyama, if one practices it completely, it will be helpful in fulfilling all the principles of Yama and Niyama."
2,41,"""The first of the rules is the rule of chastity, which is extremely important. The earlier sentence mentioned the fruit of chastity, which is the feeling of separation from one's own body and the bodies of others, but its benefits don't end there. Maharshi says that after purifying the inner and outer body through chastity, a yogi's intellect is elevated by the satva guna, which brings happiness to the mind. The Gita and many other scriptures mention that the fruit of satva is happiness. As a result, the mind remains happy and satisfied. From this happiness, a yogi's concentration is established, and he is able to control all his 10 senses. As soon as any yogi gets control over his senses, it is the first sign that he is capable of realizing his true form. For a yogi, realizing the Self is the greatest achievement. One thing to note is that when the mind is happy, our concentration is established. Therefore, it is certain that happiness is the result of concentration. A happy mind will lead to greater concentration in any task. Therefore, to increase concentration in any topic, one must connect one's happy mind with it or work on that topic with a happy mind. Both ways can increase concentration. By maintaining the purity of both the internal and external body, one can get the following benefits: 1. One's attachment to one's own body will end. 2. One's attachment to the bodies (opposite) of others will also end. 3. The satva guna will increase in one's intellect. 4. The power to distinguish between good and bad will be developed. 5. One will start experiencing happiness. 6. One will achieve concentration. 7. One will get control over one's senses. 8. The eligibility to realize the Self will be achieved."""
2,42,"""Now Maharshi talks about the fruits of satisfaction. When one attains satisfaction, a yogi gets the attainment of ultimate happiness. Those who are not satisfied always run after small pleasures and never get the permanent happiness. They become addicted to indulgence and lose the quality of self-realization. Living in perpetual dissatisfaction, they feel empty in their life and are always anxious and tensed. But those who do their part with full dedication, accept their karma's fruit as a blessing, and remain satisfied, they are truly happy. They are happy in the process of satisfaction and when satisfaction becomes a part of their life, they attain ultimate happiness. Why is satisfaction said to be the biggest happiness? - All material pleasures get exhausted and result in misery, but satisfaction is eternal. Satisfaction does not disturb you from your state but takes you to a peaceful state. It is not the same as inaction. The meaning of satisfaction is to utilize your available capacity fully and accept whatever comes as a result of your actions with a complete heart. When we utilize our full capacity, we have the desire for the fruit, but we should not evaluate it according to our scale, this is called not desiring the fruit. We can increase our effort as much as we want, but we cannot reduce or increase our desire for the fruit, because we are not authorized to decide about the fruit. This is the perspective of satisfaction. In reality, satisfaction is the foundation of all happiness."""
2,43,"""What benefits a yogi derives from completing the practice of tap, Maharshi is explaining. Tap is an important part of krya yoga. Through tap, internal conflicts are reduced, which we have discussed earlier. However, when tap is practiced with regularity and the yogi attains stabilization in it, the impurities of the body and senses are removed. The senses and body become pure and acquire special abilities. What kind of impurity is present in the body and what kind of impurity is present in the senses? - All external impurities like sweat, bad odour, or impurities are related to the body, while internal impurities like doubts, anger, and attachment manifest in the mind. In this way, when the body and both its external and internal impurities are purified. The impurity of the senses is nothing but their fluctuation or steadiness. When they become stable, this is known as the purification of the senses. If the senses are not controlled, they will lead us astray. Just as a yogi, through the practice of tap, starts to control his senses, the sattva guna increases in him. The increase of sattva guna is known as the removal of the impurity of the senses. In this way, the removal of the impurity of the body and senses is achieved through the continuous practice of tap. Just as gold is purified through heat and its impurities are removed, and it becomes radiant, the body and senses also become radiant through the fire of tap."""
2,44,"""The topic of the benefits of self-study is being discussed here. Tapas and self-study are also a part of Kriya Yoga, and now the rules of Ashtanga Yoga have also become a part of it. Discussing it twice makes it important. Such scriptures or literature that help us move forward on the path of yoga are called self-study. Such scriptures that talk about liberation, remove obstacles on the path of yoga, and their study and teaching are called self-study. Listening to and repeating the words of the sages, monks, and gurus, and contemplation and introspection are also called self-study. Reciting mantras like Gayaatri and Omkara in their true meaning is also called self-study. Self-study is a process and a means by which a yogi, even without practicing yoga, lives in yoga. Self-study keeps the yogi's inclinations on the path of yoga, keeps him connected with the environment of yoga. Those who do not rely on self-study gradually become estranged from the path of yoga and do not even realize it. It is written in the scriptures that, taking refuge in these two means of yoga and self-study, one gradually manifests the ultimate reality. When tired from yoga, practice self-study, and when tired from self-study, practice yoga again. In this way, both yoga and self-study are practiced alternately, and even the ultimate reality manifests, meaning that the lord is revealed in the yogi's heart. When the uninterrupted flow of yoga and self-study continues in life, the time of the universe comes to an end. Therefore, when the yogi is fully established in yoga and self-study, he realizes his dearest deity. As the yogi continues self-study, extraordinary faith is generated towards great personalities, gods, or sages, and divine vision begins. Along with this, one starts receiving their blessings indirectly, and they start helping him in every activity."""
2,45,"""Eishwar Pranidhan, this is the ultimate and fifth rule. Maharshi says that when a yogi achieves perfection in Eishwar Pranidhan, he gets the fruit in the form of samadhi. Eishwar Pranidhan has been considered an independent means of realization as well as a part of some spiritual practices. Therefore, Eishwar Pranidhan is an extremely important means in yoga. Eishwar Pranidhan is the culmination of devotion, where the yogi becomes egoless and takes shelter of God, offering all actions, movements, and thoughts to God. In this way, devotion is sparked, and he lives as if God is living through him. He even makes his own will one with God's will, and thus his own existence becomes one with God's existence. God is forever in a state of samadhi, meaning he is always in a state of samadhi. When the yogi drops his ego and lives as if God is living through him, his knowledge also becomes like God's knowledge, that is, self-knowledge. With self-knowledge, ignorance is destroyed, and the destruction of ignorance leads to the destruction of all five types of klechas, and then the yogi achieves the benefits of samadhi."""
2,46,"""Assana is an important limb of Ashtanga Yoga. It is a chain that remains rooted in the subsequent limbs. The practice of Yoga begins from Asana. Pranayama, Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi also remain rooted in Asana. Maharshi defines Asana as the state of the body in which the practitioner can sit comfortably and stably without moving. Many deviations can occur on the path of Yoga, hence stability is required. This stability comes from the achievement of Asana in the body and mind. Maharshi has not given a clear definition of the types of Asana. According to his definition, any position in which one can sit comfortably and stably for a long time is an Asana. Generally, it is said that as many living beings as there are on this earth, so many Asanas are there. Maharshi will explain how Asana is achieved in the next verse."""
2,47,"When a yogi practices yoga poses, he should learn how to do them through this sutra. In general, people refer to the sutra of Sthira Sukham Asanam when talking about yoga poses. However, we also need to mention the next sutra, Prayatna Shaiithilya Anantasamapatti Bhyaam. Only then can we understand the pose correctly. Here, the topic is Astanga Yoga and the third limb is the pose. In the future, we will also discuss Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi. The ultimate result of Astanga Yoga is Samadhi, so here, the sage's intention is to sit in meditation in a pose. 

Currently, we are focusing only on the pose for Pranayama, Dharana, and Dhyana, and we are trying to understand it. Maharshi is clearly saying that when practicing yoga, keep the effort relaxed. The yogi can choose any of the three asanas - Padmasana, Sukhasana, or Siddhasana - and then let go of all physical movements or activities, and attach the mind to the infinite Self. 

If the yogi relaxes his body, but does not attach his mind to the Self, his mind will roam, and his body will also become restless, and the pose will not be achieved. The pose should be stable and comfortable, and through its perfection, the body will become stable and comfortable, which will not hinder the practice of Pranayama, Dharana, and Dhyana. Therefore, the pose is an important point for Pranayama and Dhyana. Therefore, the yogi's first task is to achieve the perfect pose, and then only will he get success in the limbs of yoga. 

Today, practitioners want to jump directly to meditation, directly practicing Pranayama, but this will not bring them the full benefits. It is only through the practice of sitting in Padmasana, Sukhasana, or Siddhasana and stopping all efforts and attaching the mind to the infinite Self that the pose will be achieved, and then it will play an important role in Pranayama and meditation."
2,48,"""Just as the body and mind settle into the asana, all mental and physical distractions come to an end. When there is no distraction in the body or mind, the individual becomes free from all kinds of conflicts. When one is established in the asana, there is no movement in the body and neither is there any thought activity in the mind because the mind is established in the ultimate reality. In that case, there is no experience of hunger, thirst, gain, loss, victory, defeat, praise, or blame. Even after the body and mind have settled into the asana, such conflicts do not affect the individual in their daily life. There is a special kind of steadiness that arises in their life. The effects of conflicts that affected the body are now diminished. Similarly, those that affected the mind, such as pleasure and pain, are now minimal or completely absent. For example, conflicts like gain and loss, victory and defeat, and praise and blame. Because the mind is established in the ultimate reality during the time of asana, there is no distraction in it."""
2,49,"Maharshi has instructed to connect the mind with the Supreme Being when sitting in Asana. Thus, the accomplishment of Asana also leads to the control of the mind. The relationship between the mind and Prana is very deep. If the mind is calm, Prana is also calm and if Prana is stable, then the mind is also stable. If the mind is restless, then Prana also becomes restless. Similarly, if the Prana is restless, then the mind also becomes restless. Since Asana accomplishment makes the body and mind stable, and when such a stable body and mind practice Pranayama, then it becomes easy to stabilize the Prana. Therefore, you will be able to practice the four Pranayamas properly, which is why Asana accomplishment is extremely useful and necessary for Pranayama and further attention and concentration."
2,50,"""Maharshi has divided pranayama into four parts. In this sutra, three types are explained. These three types are: 1. Bahya Vritti Pranayama, 2. Abhyantara Vritti Pranayama, 3. Samvritti Pranayama. 1. Bahya Vritti Pranayama: It is the process of releasing the prana-vayu rapidly and then holding it outside. In yoga language, this is called rechaka. 2. Abhyantara Vritti Pranayama: It is the process of taking the prana-vayu inside and then holding it inside. In yoga language, this is called puraka. 3. Samvritti Pranayama: It is the process of holding the breath in the same place as it arises (either outside or inside). In yoga language, this is called kumbhaka. If the breath is held outside, it is called bahya kumbhaka, and if held inside, it is called anta kumbhaka or abhyantara kumbhaka. These three pranayamas are practiced according to place, time, and number. In other words, by practicing pranayama at regular intervals, one can observe how far the prana-vayu travels through the nose, how much time it takes to perform one pranayama, and how many breaths one can take in a normal state while practicing pranayama. In this way, pranayama becomes long, subtle, or light when measured or tested according to place, time, and number."""
2,51,"""This fourth pranayama is completely different from the three pranayamas explained earlier. We have understood the external and internal pranayamas, so this fourth pranayama works contrary to them. When we are doing external pranayama, we hold the breath outside and feel the need to bring it in after some time. If we inhale inside at that moment, it becomes external pranayama, but if we hold the breath outside and then push it out, it becomes this fourth pranayama. So, after doing this once, when we feel the urge to inhale, if we try to hold the breath outside and then push it out again, it becomes another practice of this fourth pranayama. In this way, when we hold the breath inside and then bring it outside, we will feel the urge to let it go, but if we hold it inside again, it becomes this fourth pranayama. As long as we try this many times, this fourth pranayama is said to be this. After doing external and internal pranayamas, when we practice contrary to the urge to inhale and exhale, this is called the fourth pranayama.

Some precautions related to pranayama:

1. Those who are practicing should only start practicing pranayama when they have achieved mental clarity.
2. Those practicing for health should practice pranayama and asanas simultaneously.
3. Pranayama should always be practiced on an empty stomach, so that the flow of pranic energy is proper and the body is not engaged in any other activity.
4. One should not practice pranayama too vigorously initially. 
5. One should start practicing pranayama slowly and in small portions initially.
As for the pranayamas being discussed here in Yoga scriptures, they should not be practiced when one is sick, but can be done slowly and gradually, and one will certainly obtain benefits."""
2,52,"""When the practice of Asanas reaches perfection and Pranayama is practiced systematically, the curtain of ignorance that has been cast over the knowledge of the self starts to lift slowly. As much as ignorance is destroyed by Pranayama, that much illumination of self-knowledge also occurs within the yogi. Through the continuous practice of Pranayama, the body is purified on one hand, and the impurities of the mind are also washed away on the other. As the defects of the body and mind are destroyed, clarity of the mind also sets in. The ability to perceive the self and the person as separate entities increases. The understanding of the self and the person as separate entities is the veil that is destroyed through Pranayama. Through the practice of Pranayama, both the mind and the prana come under control together, leading to increased focus. Special control is established over the senses. Once the Asanas are perfected and Pranayama also becomes stable, there is special progress in Pratyahara, Dharana, and Dhyana."""
2,53,"""The discussion of the second benefit of pranayama is being conducted here. With the regular practice of pranayama, a special control over the mind arises, and the ability to concentrate the mind anywhere increases. A yogi can concentrate the mind anywhere, whether inside the body or outside. The highest state of pratyahara, dharana, and dhyana can be achieved by concentrating the mind. Yoga can either occur in a state of concentration or a state of calmness. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to have special speed in pranayama after achieving the stability of the pose. If there is control over the mind and senses, pratyahara is possible, and if pratyahara takes place, then dharana and dhyana can occur in a specific place, and the yogi's concentration can take place. Everything is interconnected in yoga."""
2,54,""" Maharshi now explains to his disciples about withdrawal. After doing pranayama, when a yogi's control starts to come over the mind and senses, then it is necessary to control the senses over their respective subjects in order to accomplish concentration and meditation. By nature, the senses are extroverted and move towards their respective subjects, and this extroversion is the obstacle in yoga, causing concentration and meditation to falter. It is absolutely necessary for the senses to turn inward and follow the form of the mind. This is what is called withdrawal, or the senses' sustenance is their respective subjects, and relinquishing that sustenance is withdrawal. When the senses do not move towards their subjects and are established in the true nature of the mind, the yogi gains the power to concentrate and can try to fix the stopped mind at a particular place."""
2,55,"When the power of withdrawal has been obtained, i.e., when the yogi has become capable of withdrawing his senses, then he gets a special control or dominance over his senses. In reality, he approaches the state of sensory victory, which means controlling his senses according to his own desires. The eight branches of Ashtanga Yoga, each with its own significance, are to be practiced by the yogi. All these eight branches, when properly nurtured by the yogi, become helpful for the accomplishment of each other. In this way, the significance of withdrawal is also great and very great. If withdrawal is not achieved, the yogi cannot keep his mind at one place for a long time. His senses will be out of his control, and his mind will keep getting attracted to the objects of his senses. However, the fulfillment of withdrawal is dependent on the fulfillment of pranayama, and it is necessary to practice pranayama properly without which control over the senses will not be achieved. In Yoga, everything is dependent on each other, and therefore, the principle of completeness is essential. Until yoga is practiced with a complete perspective, it is not possible to make actual progress. When the yogi has successfully achieved the state of withdrawal, along with posture and pranayama, his senses begin to be directed according to his own preferences, not on the basis of external objects, but in accordance with his own inner wisdom. In this state, the yogi attains stasis and becomes prepared for contemplation and concentration. The supreme control over the senses, what is it? It is when withdrawal has not been achieved, the senses used to take the person wherever they wanted, and even against his will, the person would get attracted to worldly objects and would regret later. Even while practicing yoga, one would often get deviated and then would repent and feel regret. But when withdrawal is achieved, then neither would his senses be attracted to worldly objects, nor would he feel any regret or deviation. He becomes one-pointed and then moves forward on the path of yoga without any obstacles."
3,1,"""The practitioner, as he practices various yogic disciplines, achieves a specific state and acquires siddhis as a result. These siddhis are obtained in a specific way through yoga and are achieved through the various angas of yoga. Maharshi has described this in the Vijnana Pada. In every sutra of Yoga Darshan, there is a subtle flow and concealment of a thread. Just as we understood in the previous chapters (Samadhi Pada and Sadhana Pada) what the mind is and its nature, Maharshi is now explaining the concept of 'dhariana' in a special context. 

When the mind is concentrated through yogic practices, then it becomes necessary to prepare it to be fixed on a specific point, organ, or location in the body, such as the navel, crown of the head, or heart region. Maharshi calls this process 'dhariana'. This is a formulaic sutra that defines the process of concentrating the mind on a specific point. 

What is the purpose of dhariana? Maharshi will explain this in the next sutras. Dhariana is one of the inner angas of yoga, along with other angas of yoga. 

In Yoga Darshan, some sutras are defining, some sutras are transformative, and some sutras are extensive. However, all the sutras have a set of guidelines for the practitioner, which must be followed. 

How to practice dhariana? The practitioner should begin by choosing a comfortable spot within or outside the body, and focus their attention on a specific point. The initial freedom to choose the spot is available, but as practice continues, the practitioner will naturally move towards focusing within the body. 

Regular practice of yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, and pratyahara helps the practitioner develop the ability to focus the mind and achieve the state of dhariana. Therefore, the sequence of practice is also important. The sequential practice of the eight angas of yoga yields quick results. 

As the practitioner's ability to focus increases, the mind becomes calm, peaceful, and stable. This practice of dhariana helps the practitioner become introverted and gain control over their senses."""
3,2,"""After explaining the instructions related to understanding, we are now discussing the second internal practice, meditation. Maharshi Patanjali has placed great importance on the sequence in the entire yoga system. Defining each subject clearly, he explains its practice, and then presents the next subject in a concise manner. While explaining the definition of meditation, Maharshi says that a practitioner who has established their attention (at a specific location, such as the navel center, the tip of the nose, the forehead, or the palate) can maintain the flow of knowledge related to that subject for as long as he or she focuses. This is called meditation. If a yoga practitioner establishes their attention at the crown of the head and maintains the knowledge of the formless Lord for as long as they focus, they can understand that they have achieved meditation. Initially, a practitioner's meditation may be limited to a short period, but with regular practice, their focus can improve, and they can maintain it for a longer period. As their focus improves, the practitioner's mind becomes one-pointed, and they can control their senses at will. When a practitioner achieves this level of focus, they can progress in both the physical and spiritual realms. That is why the word 'meditation' is most commonly used in all of India. Everyone, from the elderly to the young, repeats the phrase 'live with meditation, eat with meditation, work with meditation, and speak with meditation.' Meditation is the most commonly used word in India, but due to the absence of Vedic education, its significance has been reduced to a mere possibility. As yoga has gained recognition globally, discussions have begun about all eight branches of yoga, with meditation being the most prominent topic. By understanding and establishing what is beneficial, we can expand our meditation and solve all problems in life."""
3,3,"After the practice of concentration and meditation, Maharshi Patanjali is now explaining the third inner means of yoga, Samadhi. When a devotee, with full effort, practices the five external limbs of yoga, including yama and niyama, and comes to a state of stability in meditation, he becomes one with the object of meditation. In this state, the devotee forgets his own self and even the fact that he was meditating. He knows only the form of the object of meditation. For example, if a devotee, with intense focus, meditates on the form of the ultimate reality, Parameshwar, he remains in that state for as long as he meditates. He becomes one with Parameshwar and knows only its form. At that point, he is unaware of his own existence and is completely immersed in the bliss of Parameshwar. As long as the meditation remains unbroken, the state of Samadhi also remains. Therefore, you may have heard people say, ""The meditation breaks,"" ""The Samadhi breaks."" Sage Vyasa has called yoga Samadhi and has named its attainment as Samadhan. In reality, yoga is Samadhan. If there is any alternative to Samadhan in this physical world, it is only yoga. If you live under the shelter of yoga, you can lift your entire life out of all difficulties. Whether it is a healthy life or an ideal way of living, everything is possible through yoga. When our life is filled with balance, we can be happy and gain bliss, because one without balance is miserable and poor. If a person does not include the three inner limbs of yoga, ""Dharana-Dhyana-Samadhi,"" in his life, he invites imbalance in life. If we do not practice inner effort, despite external efforts, this imbalance is the result. Therefore, both external and internal efforts are necessary for balance in life."
3,4,"""Practicing the last three limbs of Ashtanga Yoga, that is, concentration, contemplation, and meditation, on a single object is called self-restraint. Maharishi refers to concentration, contemplation, and meditation as self-restraint through this scripture. In the subsequent sutras of Yoga-Darshan, Maharishi will speak of fixing attention, contemplation, and meditation on a single object, a single location, or internal organs of the body without using the words concentration, contemplation, and meditation separately, but will only say that by controlling the attention on that specific location, organ, or otherwise, one will achieve specific results. Through this scripture, concentration, contemplation, and meditation are given the collective name ""self-restraint"". However, it is worthy of attention that we can name it self-restraint only when concentration, contemplation, and meditation are on the same subject, object, and in the same flow. Alternatively, one can understand that when Maharishi speaks of self-restraint, it means practicing concentration, contemplation, and meditation on the same subject, location, or organ. Only after having a balanced mind, that is, after concentration, contemplation, and meditation, one can attain the desired fruit."""
3,5,"""Mastery of restraint, meditation, and concentration, which is called self-control in one form, brings about a wonderful illumination of knowledge in the practitioner. In this sutra, the sage has explained what fruit one gets by practicing restraint first. As long as self-control is not attained, the ordinary knowledge of worldly objects and subjects remains. However, when self-control is attained, accurate knowledge of these subjects begins to manifest. This attainment is obtained through practice. At the time of obtaining this kind of knowledge, the practitioner should be careful not to let ego enter within, because all attainments can bring ego along with them. If the practitioner remains vigilant and aware, but does not, then he may fall from his position within a short time and his practice may become disrupted. Therefore, Maharshi has given a special caution at the end to be careful while achieving these attainments. When self-control is attained, the practitioner's mind becomes less tamasic and rajasic, and satvic tendencies become more prominent, leading to a special experience of knowledge. To maintain this state of the mind, the practitioner should continue to practice self-control. It should be noted that here, self-control is referred to as a unity with dharana, dhyana, and samadhi."""
3,6,"When a devotee attains special intelligence from self-control, he should use that intelligence and move forward in the same shelter. Because that special intelligence has been given to him to help him move forward in stages in his spiritual practice. This is a kind of blessing from God. It is said that one should enter yoga gradually, gradually, because gradual progress and gradual experience make the path of yoga easier and easier. But if one is in a hurry and takes shortcuts, both spiritual practice and the effort of yoga will be in vain. Therefore, Maharsi has directed through this sutra to use that special intelligence which arises from self-control, but gradually move forward. As soon as this special intelligence comes to the devotee, it will enlighten him about the next stage of yoga. The devotee should again establish himself in close proximity to yoga through the practices of dhyana, dharana, and samadhi. Maharsi is emphasizing the importance of gradual spiritual practice and gradual attainment of results through this sutra. The special intelligence that arises from self-control will naturally come to the devotee, but Maharsi is again warning him to prevent any kind of human mistake."
3,7,"""Two words, means and end, are found in yoga. The means by which the end is achieved is called means. For example, if one wants to reach Delhi from Haridwar, then reaching Delhi is the end and traveling from Haridwar to Delhi by bus or car is the means. Similarly, a yogi's goal to achieve self-awareness and superconscious state is the end, and the two means by which he can achieve it are. The two means of achieving yoga realization are: external means, internal means. The limbs of yoga (yam, niyam, asan, pranayam, and pratyahar) are referred to as external means, whereas the three stages of contemplation, meditation, and self-realization are known as internal means. The internal means for achieving self-awareness are yam, niyam, asan, pranayam, and pratyahar, but for achieving superconscious state, these external means become internal means and contemplation, meditation, and self-realization become internal means. The external means are those which help achieve the end indirectly, whereas internal means are those which help achieve the end directly. Just as some means are essential for the success of any work, so too are some means essential for yoga realization, and the rest are secondary but necessary. Therefore, the sages have considered contemplation, meditation, and self-realization as internal means for achieving self-awareness."""
3,8,"""The internal practices mentioned earlier, such as dharana, dhyana, and samadhi, which were described as being seen through the lens of yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, and pratyahara, transform into external practices and become nirvikalpa samadhi, or asamprajnata samadhi, in their view. For asamprajnata samadhi, there is no need for a support or means, whereas for samprajnata samadhi, a support or means is required. Therefore, the yogi moves forward towards a means without any support or need, which, upon its practice, does not lead to the fragmentation of asamprajnata samadhi. One's detachment, or vairagya, which is a feeling that is born after one's realization of the Self, does not get fragmented. Rather, it generates a power within the yogi, where they can, of their own free will, re-establish themselves in asamprajnata samadhi. Detachment is that state of consciousness where all vrittis, or mental modifications, come to an end, and the yogi does not yearn for anything other than the ultimate reality. However, only when the yogi has practiced all eight limbs of yoga and experienced their fruit, does this state of detachment, or vairagya, arise within them, bringing them peace, tranquility, and filling them with the joy of the ultimate Father, the Lord."""
3,9,"""Maharshi Chit about the subtle aspect of the mind through this sutra is revealing that in moments of sadhana, there are different types of sanskaras that arise and subside, and as a result, the mind's state and its consequences change. This sutra helps in understanding the mind. It is known that in the Sadhana Pada, the mind is described as having 5 types of substrates - (1) Kshipta, (2) Mudha, (3) Vikshipta, (4) Ekagrata, and (5) Niruddha. Moreover, it is also said that yoga is only possible in the Ekagrata and Niruddha states. Therefore, one should strive to attain these two substrates. When a sadhak attains the Ekagrata state and practices yoga, one is then influenced by the impressions of this life or past lives, and the mind oscillates between different states, sometimes experiencing good sanskaras, which are referred to as Nirodha Sanskaras, and sometimes experiencing bad sanskaras, which are referred to as Vyutthana Sanskaras. Both these sanskaras come and go. These good and bad sanskaras, (Vyutthana and Nirodha), are also relinquished as per expectation. Those sanskaras that are arrested in the Samprajnata Samadhi become active again in the Asamprajnata Samadhi, i.e., are relinquished. Therefore, in yoga practice, one first attains a few sanskaras and then, taking the support of knowledge and detachment, one attains a higher state. Thus, the mind's equipoise and the oscillation between sanskaras is the result."""
3,10,"""Earlier, Maharshi had said that the outcome of restraining the mind was revealed through the earlier script. Now, he is saying that when the mind is restrained along with the habits of devotion, what state does the mind remain in? When the habits of expansion get suppressed and the habits of restraint become prominent, and they remain constantly like a stream of oil, the mind becomes perfectly calm and peaceful, i.e., pure and spotless. It is only due to the habits of restraint that the mind reaches such a calm and peaceful state. Therefore, a seeker on the path of yoga must cross various stages, trying to eliminate the habits of expansion and cultivate the habits of restraint. It is also possible that the habits, like the habits of restraint, can elevate one's state to a higher level, only to give rise to new habits of expansion when one reaches the state of realization. Thus, yoga practice always keeps some freshness and newness, and one must continue to practice new means to reach new states and leave behind those habits that are based on those practices. One must sometimes abandon those habits without attachment and move forward. Just as we leave behind the raft that brought us to the shore when crossing a river, we can't cling to it and expect to reach the ultimate destination. Therefore, a yoga practitioner sometimes forgets the ultimate goal due to attachment to a particular practice. Therefore, the transformation of the habits of restraint into expansion is necessary to attain a higher and new state of yoga."""
3,11,"sattva, rajas, and tamas. As a result, it oscillates between five states: kshipt, muudh, vikshipt, ekagr, and niruddh. The goal is to effortfully bring the mind under control by making it one-pointed and tranquil. When the mind is not one-pointed or tranquil, it is prone to distractions and wandering, and this hampers one's progress on the spiritual path.

The solution lies in making effort to keep the mind one-pointed and tranquil, and this can be achieved through regular practice and meditation. When the mind is in a one-pointed and tranquil state, it is capable of deep concentration and experience.

It is essential to understand the process of the mind and its various states in order to make progress on the spiritual path. If one fails to understand the mind and its workings, it may lead to failure in achieving one's goals.

The mind must be brought under control before one can achieve success on the spiritual path. This control can be achieved through regular practice and meditation.

The mind is like a restless horse, and it requires patience and persistence to tame it. One must make effort to calm the mind and steer it towards the right path.

The process of bringing the mind under control is a gradual one, and it requires patience and persistence. One must first bring the mind to a state of one-pointedness and then gradually cultivate tranquility.

The goal is to make the mind a ripe instrument for spiritual growth and self-realization, and this can be achieved through regular practice and meditation."
3,12,"When a practitioner focuses his mind through the medium of Kriya Yoga or through the medium of practice and renunciation, and treats it as Yoga, then gradually, as a result of the focused mind, his cognitive knowledge regarding his object of meditation becomes unbroken and constant. It remains as a constant stream of knowledge. The mind, when engaged in this constant stream of knowledge, produces a wave of the same knowledge and it becomes a part of his experience, just like an uninterrupted flow of knowledge. In the previous sutra, the mind was restless, and when it became focused, its focused state would disappear, and when it was focused, restlessness would also disappear. However, in the focused state of the mind, there is an uninterrupted flow of unbroken and constant knowledge, which Maharishi has described as the result of focus. This sutra describes the outcome of focus and its scientific process. Just like how an oil stream flowing downward appears to be constant and uninterrupted, but in reality, it is the continuous merger of oil molecules, this process occurs with such intensity that it becomes perceptible to the senses. Similarly, in the focus of the mind, this same science is hidden, where one wave of knowledge is followed by another wave of the same knowledge with such intensity that the mind does not have any interval or pause between them, and it cannot think about any other subject or knowledge."
3,13,"""In the ancient texts, Maharshi discussed the results of controlling the mind, abandoning thoughts, and focusing attention. Now, they are explaining the results of the five elements, the nature, characteristics, and stages of the senses, based on the divisions of sense organs, elements, and stages. The point to be understood is that Maharshi calls the separate results of these 'understanding oneself'. The question arises as to how one can understand oneself, and Maharshi says that one should understand as I have explained the results of control, of the mind, and of focus attention. According to my view, there are two possible meanings to this statement. One is that even if we understand only the results of control, mind, and focus attention, and move forward on the path of yoga, it is still good, and we can understand the results related to the nature, characteristics, and stages of elements and senses based on physical knowledge. The second is that one should understand solely from this description, because nothing is obstructed by this explanation. Now, let us understand what is the result of the nature, characteristics, and stages of the five elements and senses. So, first, let us understand the meaning of the three words used here. Here, the word 'dharma' means 'quality', the word 'lakshan' means 'change', and the word 'avastha' means 'condition'. Maharshi is saying that the results also differ based on the qualities, characteristics, and different conditions of the five elements or senses. The five elements, earth, water, fire, air, and sky, each have their own distinct qualities, when changes occur in them, it is called the result of the elements, and its physical transformation will be different, but the process or mode of occurrence will be the same. Similarly, the qualities of the senses will also undergo physical transformations, but the process or mode of occurrence will be the same. Similarly, one should also understand the characteristics and stages of the elements and senses."""
3,14,"""The word 'Dharma' appeared in the previous sutra, which Maharshi is explaining through this sutra. We previously considered virtues as the meaning of Dharma. Now, Maharshi is defining it according to the Shastric definition, saying that any entity or principle whose transformation occurs in accordance with time or state remains unchanged in all three times (past, present, and future), whether it undergoes significant changes due to Dharma, characteristics, and state. According to Shastra, Dharma is defined as this. This is primarily a technical definition. In this context, the word 'Shanti' refers to past time, 'Udita' refers to present time, and 'Avyapadeshya' refers to future time."""
3,15,"""After defining the concept of dharma, a question arises as to whether the inherent nature present in every substance remains the same throughout all times and eras. The scriptures answer this question by saying that the outcome or consequence of dharma changes according to the order or sequence of the substance. For instance, a lump of earth that is solid may be crushed into fine powder, and as a result, its inherent nature changes. Similarly, if the solid lump of earth is dipped in water, it becomes soggy and changes its nature again. In this way, the outcome of dharma changes according to the sequence of the substance.

We can analyze this concept in the context of yoga philosophy. Our body, mind, intellect, heart, and soul are all akin to a substance that undergoes different transformations and changes according to the passage of time. These changes can be accelerated by incorporating yoga practices and disciplines into our lives. For instance, by consuming only pure food, the body will become flexible. When combined with yoga postures, the body will become both flexible and strong. Similarly, through meditation and chanting, the mind, intellect, heart, and soul will also undergo transformations and changes.

Therefore, the outcome or consequence of dharma changes according to the sequence or order of the substance. Similarly, in yoga, the sequence of asanas, diet, and exercise also determines the outcome. By following this sequence, we can achieve auspicious outcomes."""
3,16,"Here, in Vibhuti Pada, the word ""Vibhuti"" means powers or energies. Which is the basis for calling the third chapter Vibhuti Pada. Now, the description of those powers is starting. Before that, all the previous sutras have completed the definitions and explanations of all the necessary words, and Maharshi has also answered all the questions and doubts of the disciples. So, now we are describing the powers as they come.

The first power is that of knowing about the past and future of any object or substance. How this realization comes and its complete mechanism, Maharshi is explaining briefly.

Before understanding this sutra, one should understand the two words ""Sanyam"" and ""Parinama"". ""Sanyam"" refers to the three - Dhyan, Dhyaan, and Samadhi. When practiced together, Maharshi calls it Sanyam, so the meaning of the sutra becomes clear.

""Parinama"" is the word that means the result, characteristics, and state of any object or substance. To understand it clearly, one should read the explanation of sutra 13 in Vibhuti Pada again.

Sanyam is important to understand because Maharshi will later explain how to practice Sanyam in different parts of the body or in external objects. When the subject becomes clear in the understanding of the mind or intellect, it manifests in action.

Maharshi is saying that by practicing Sanyam together with Dhyan, Dhyaan, and Samadhi, one can know the past and future of any object or substance. In this way, the yogi can obtain this Vibhuti."
3,17,"""The essence of words, their meaning, and the processes that arise from them are interconnected. The three aspects of a word, namely, its name, meaning, and knowledge, are intricately linked. In daily life, people do not usually contemplate the composition of words in this manner, but upon subtle observation, one can comprehend the mechanism of the universe and the process of action. Maharshi Patanjali wishes to take us on a journey to understand this subtlety, where we can grasp the laws of the universe and attain subtle powers.

When a yogi practices dhyanam (meditation) on words, their meanings, and their knowledge, and gradually masters this practice, he comes to know the meaning of all words uttered by all living beings. This implies that the yogi acquires the ability to comprehend the vibrational resonance of all words, including those spoken by animals and humans.

For practice: Take the word 'Paramatma' (Divine Self). First, focus on the word itself, then its meaning, and finally, the knowledge associated with it. Continuously practice dhyanam on the word 'Paramatma' along with its meaning and knowledge. This will lead to concentration, and you will no longer be distracted by other experiences.

Meaning: To synchronize with the meaning of the word 'Paramatma' means to establish control over the form that appears in the mind after uttering the word. Now, we will take the concept of light as an example, just as thousands of suns shine simultaneously. The Paramatma is of the nature of light.

Knowledge: When we practice synchronization with the knowledge of the word 'Paramatma', we realize that Paramatma is all-pervading, and all beings are immersed in it. It is the source of all good virtues, joy, enthusiasm, love, devotion, faith, simplicity, and straightforwardness. This is the boundless reservoir of knowledge, and we must practice meditation on this concept. In this way, when we attain this state, we will know all words, their meanings, and knowledge."""
3,18,"""The description of the process is as follows: When the yogi focuses on his own habits and tendencies, and combines effort with concentration and self-realization, he gains knowledge about his past lives. This means he comes to know in which incarnation he was in the past, and what his relationships, habits, and tendencies were. The yogi learns how he carries out his actions and what impressions he creates through his behavior. He comes to know how his habits are shaped by his past actions and how they affect his present life. Through this process, he realizes how his past actions create patterns and habits that manifest in his current life. He also realizes that if he can control his habits and tendencies, he can gain knowledge about his past lives. The yogi understands that some of his habits are due to his past actions, and some may be due to the actions of others. In general, children's consciousness is very pure and clean, and they are said to retain memories of their past lives. Hence, children often laugh and cry suddenly, seemingly without reason. Since they have a long life ahead of them, their natural tendency is to forget their past lives and it is said that their present life's habits also get forgotten in the process."""

Maharshi says that when a yogi makes the knowledge of another person his own subject of control, i.e., he maintains his concentration, meditation, and absorption on that knowledge simultaneously, then the yogi comes to know the thoughts, habits, and tendencies of that person. How does the yogi take another's mind as his own subject of control? It is as simple as concentrating, meditating, and absorbing on one's own mind. A yogi, who knows someone, takes that person's mind as his own subject of control, choosing the way that person thinks, feels, and acts, and then maintains his control over it steadily. As a result of long practice, the yogi comes to know the knowledge that appears in that person's mind. This is possible in daily life too, when someone studies the ways of another person, his mannerisms, his habits, and his every situation, and comes to know something about that person. Sometimes he even makes a very accurate prediction. This is a common process, but when done through yogic practices and the knowledge given by the seer, it becomes a sacred ritual. According to Maharshi, it is absolutely true that one can gain knowledge of another's mind."""
3,20,"""The great sage is saying that a yogi only gains knowledge of the emotions that are arising in their own mind when they practice control over another person's mind, and not of the other person's objects of knowledge. The intention is that a yogi gains knowledge of the emotions and impressions that are operating in another person's mind, but they do not know the object, person, or thing towards which those emotions are directed. This is why a yogi only gains knowledge of the emotions that are arising in their own mind. The sage is explaining the importance of the practice of control and how it allows for greater understanding. As much as the scope of control increases, so does the possibility of knowledge. 

When we talk about miracles, the word 'miracle' comes to mind. But Maharshi Patanjali includes both the process and the result in his discussion of miracles, and this makes everything meaningful from a scientific perspective. 

The Supreme Being has created the entire universe in such a way that when a person thinks and researches about it, they create something new and are also drawn towards the Supreme Being. The various types of miracles that are seen daily in this universe are not meant to cause people to forget the Supreme Being, but rather to bring people's minds towards the Supreme Being."""
3,21,"The Sage is explaining about the subtle manifestation of the self. When a yogi practices detachment (kaivalya) and controls the intellect, he can disappear from the sight of others. How a yogi can mentally control his physical body and thereby become invisible is understood here. Whatever object or being is not visible to us is either in darkness, extremely subtle, or very far away. In such cases, the yogi becomes invisible by either becoming extremely subtle or by extinguishing his physical form. However, the Sage here is not talking about becoming invisible in darkness, but about the yogi's physical form not being visible to others due to the absence of mental control. The Sage says that when the yogi's physical body is merged with his divine self, it is not visible to others. The yogi's physical body, form, color, and shape are completely under his control, and with this control, he achieves the state of being invisible.

Therefore, here are two means to gain knowledge of one's impending death: one through practicing control over activities that yield quick results and another through observing omens. How can one gain knowledge of his impending death through practicing control over activities that yield quick results and those that yield results late? When the yogi practices control over activities that yield quick results and those that yield results late, he recalls his past actions. As he does so, a pattern emerges in his mind, which strengthens his intuition about his future. He starts to remember all the actions he has not yet experienced the consequences of. The yogi starts to have an inkling of when these actions will bear fruit. Similarly, our life is also the fruit of some actions, and death is also an action that will bear fruit in the future. Therefore, when the yogi takes control of his actions in the form of death, he gains knowledge of his impending death. This process helps us understand many deeds and their fruits, and we experience the outcome of many actions, while some remain unmanifest. On one hand, this practice yields enlightenment, while on the other hand, it provides an opportunity to understand the arrangement of life, action, and the fruit of action, and the practice of sadhana advances in our life."""

When a yogi practices these four means separately, he obtains the corresponding powers of friendship, compassion, joy, and dispassion. By combining focus (dharana) and meditation (dhyana), a yogi develops friendship with people of similar tastes. This friendship is considered the greatest power for a seeker. Without good company and spiritual gatherings, discernment (viveka) does not arise. Therefore, self-study (svadhyaya) is highly important on the path of Yoga. By being in contact with respected and righteous souls in society, a yogi develops ease and simplicity on his Yogic path. Similarly, by practicing control (samyama) over compassion, a yogi is filled with unconditioned compassion for all living beings and gets the power of compassion, which helps his heart become stable and attain self-realization. In the same way, by practicing control over joy, a yogi obtains the power of joy, which brings happiness from within.

The strength of an elephant is similar to other kinds of strength that exist, and if we apply separate control over each of these, they all become accessible to the yogi. Control means firmness, continuous devotion, and enthusiasm. When control is practiced in this way, the yogi achieves physical strength similar to that of an elephant. Similarly, if mental strength is controlled, the yogi achieves great mental strength. If the strength of the self is controlled, the yogi achieves self-strength. And when Brahman's strength is controlled, the yogi achieves Brahman's strength, which is the greatest of all.

The yogi's perception is not limited to what is physically perceivable, and they can gain knowledge of subtle phenomena and distant objects.

According to the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, in the 36th Sutra of the Samadhi Pada, he writes ""Vishoka va jyotishmati.""

As the previous Sutras have already discussed Siddhis, the disciples had an innate inquiry about whether these Siddhis can be attained only through the practices of Dharna, Dhyana, and Samadhi, or if there are other causes as well. The disciples also wondered whether Siddhis can be attained solely through the practice of Yoga, or if there are other means as well. Then Maharshi tells the disciples that Siddhis can be attained through five means. 

Janma Siddhi: This is where a yogi, who had a good condition in his previous birth but did not complete his practices due to prarabda karma, receives Siddhis from birth itself.

Oushadhi Siddhi: This is where a yogi receives Siddhis through the use of herbs. When a yogi fully controls his body or some external organ or substance, he receives Siddhis.

Mantra Siddhi: This is where a yogi receives Siddhis through the regular chanting of mantras. When the mind is fully concentrated through the chanting of mantras, the yogi receives Siddhis related to the mind.

Tap Siddhi: This is where a yogi receives Siddhis through physical, mental, or spiritual austerities. The practice of austerities gives the yogi control over the body, senses, and the five elements. 

 Samadhi Siddhi: This is where a yogi receives Siddhis through the practice of yoga, where the citta (mind) becomes pure, and one attains control over the other elements. When the yogi practices yoga, he receives many Siddhis.

4,2,"Our physical body and senses are vast means for moving forward on the path of yoga. Both contain dormant powers. The body and senses, mind, intellect, and heart are all outcomes of nature. And, in fact, nature has inherent completeness in every created thing. However, human life is a journey. Therefore, nature has created the means of harnessing the dormant powers and embedded completeness within them. Now, it is human duty to unleash their dormant potential and attain completeness. When a yogi practices yoga and uses the means and accomplishments of yoga, they attain nature's completeness. As a result, they develop complete potential in their physical body, senses, mind, intellect, and heart. The transformation that occurs in the previous body, senses, mind, intellect, and heart is referred to as ""jatyantar"" in the language of yoga. This is a definition. Maharsi also explain that jatyantar occurs when one's nature becomes complete or one gains complete control over nature. Additionally, this implies that the body and senses, mind, intellect, and heart become endowed with special or natural potential through the path of yoga. To attain this potential, Maharsi have described various means, practices, and methods, from samadhi-pad to vibhuti-pad."
4,3,"In the first sutra of the Kavalya (Self-Realization) path, five ways of achievement are explained, namely, birth, medicine, mantra, austerity, and Samadhi. These five paths of self-realization do not change the process or method of nature, but rather remove obstacles and hurdles that come in the way of the yogi. In nature's own process, there is no interference. Therefore, the sages call them nimittas. Nimitta is something that is not involved in action but is a support for the completeness of work. The sages are illustrating this with the example of a farmer. Like a farmer, one plants a seed in the field and waits for it to germinate. But with time, unwanted weeds, thorns, etc. grow along with the crop. These weeds prevent the crop from growing properly and also prevent the essential nutrients from being utilized, resulting in poor yield. The farmer periodically removes the weeds to ensure that the crop grows fully. Similarly, these paths remove the obstacles and hurdles in the body, senses, mind, intellect, and heart, making the yogi's mind pure, free from pollutions, and enabling him to achieve eventual goals, including the ultimate goal of kaivalya. The sages are saying that these paths only remove the obstacles on the path of yoga and do not assert their authority over nature, protecting the earlier established doctrine."
4,4,"The present sequence is about the formation of the mind, which is commonly referred to as the ""Chitta"" in Sanskrit. Sage says that the mind is formed from the entity of ""Astitva"" or ""Ahankar"". In Sankhya philosophy, there is a discussion about the origin of 25 entities, and it has been calculated what is formed from what. Sat, Rajas, and Tamas are considered to be in a state of equilibrium, which is referred to as nature. From these three entities, ""Mahattatva"" is formed. This ""Mahattatva"" is also referred to as ""Buddhi"". Then, from ""Mahattatva"" or ""Buddhi"", ""Astitva"" or ""Ahankar"" is formed. From this ""Astitva"" or ""Ahankar"", the mind or Chitta is formed. Thus, the root cause of the formation of the mind is the entity of ""Astitva"" or ""Ahankar"". Whenever an entity is formed from another entity, it is referred to as a ""Utpadan"" cause. Therefore, wherever the term ""Utpadan"" cause is mentioned in scriptures, it means that some entity has been formed from another. Sage has used the word ""Chitta"" in the plural form here. According to this, the formation of the mind from the entity of ""Astitva"" is a fact. However, it is difficult to understand why the mind is not single and is multiple. Then, why has Sage used the term ""Chitta"" in the plural form? This question arises in everyone's mind. It is certain that the mind is not multiple, as Sage confirms in the next sequence. Perhaps Sage has written this sequence to resolve the doubts about the multiplicity of the mind. 

In the sequence ""Pravrittibhede prayojakam chittam ekam anekesham"", Sage is clearly saying that the mind is a single entity that performs different activities based on the differences in its tendencies. This is clear that the mind is not multiple, but performs multiple activities based on its tendencies. However, the mind performs multiple activities, which is why Sage has referred to it in the plural form. And in this way, the formation of the mind with multiple activities from the entity of ""Astitva"" or ""Ahankar"""
4,5,"""It was mentioned in the previous scripture that the construction of the mind is from the concept of 'asmita'. Maharsi used the word 'chittani' in that scripture to indicate the mind. This raised a doubt whether the mind is one or many. In order to resolve this doubt and establish the theory, Maharsi is explaining this scripture here. The mind is influenced by the qualities of nature and as a result, it operates differently in various subjects. Because the mind is constructed from 'asmita', but is influenced by the effects of 'satva', 'raja', and 'tamas'. Due to the rising and setting of the three gunas and their mixed relationship, various tendencies also arise in the mind. Therefore, the mind operates differently according to its tendencies in various subjects, thoughts, and desires, yet it remains one. Similarly, gold remains the same in various types of ornaments. In this way, Maharsi has resolved the doubt that arose in the previous scripture by saying that the mind is of a single kind."""
4,6,"""Talking about self or ego as a substratum of the mind, which is a cause, Maharishi is saying something new that the mind built through the practice of meditation is free of all kinds of desires. Such a mind, founded through meditation, has no foundation for karma or past impressions. Just as the first verse of Kaula Pad mentions five ways to attain realization, the mind becomes shaped by five practices. However, the practices of birth, medicine, mantra, and austerity take the mind to the stage of karma and its impressions, but the mind built through samadhi is free from karma and its impressions. When the mind is built through meditation, all actions become reduced to seeds. Just as a seed cannot sprout after being burnt, similarly, a mind that has been burnt or reduced to seeds cannot have any impressions."""
4,7,"The sage is saying in this thread that the actions of yogis transcend good and bad karma. In other words, they do not perform actions with the intention of gaining good karma or avoiding bad karma. Their actions are natural and effortless. Whatever they do, it is always good. Others, on the other hand, have three types of actions. Shukla karma is that which is good, brings well-being to the individual and the collective, and brings rewards to the doer. This kind of action is also considered good by society. One who has a predominance of the sattva guna performs shukla karma. One who leads a good life, practices self-reflection, and adopts yoga can also perform shukla karma.

Krishna karma is that which is unwholesome, brings harm to the individual and sometimes to society as well. This kind of action is performed when the sattva guna is suppressed and the rajas and tamas gunas are dominant. One who associates with bad company, lacks self-reflection, does not practice austerities, and does not practice yoga can also perform krishna karma.

Shukla-karma and Krishna-karma are those who are not fully established in yoga, and their actions are mixed, sometimes good and sometimes bad. However, one who practices yoga can transcend these three gunas and perform actions that are not affected by good or bad karma. Therefore, we all should strive to perform actions that are beyond the three gunas."
4,8,"""In the previous sutra, Maharshi explained that the actions of ordinary people who are different from yogis can be categorized into three types. These three types of actions are: white actions, black actions, and mixed actions. Those whose lives are filled with these three types of actions are driven by desires that arise from the consequences of their actions, that is, they are driven by intentions that arise from the quality of their actions. Just as actions can be classified as auspicious, inauspicious, or a mix of both, the desires that arise in a person are also of the same quality. Maharshi is discussing the direct mathematical relationship between actions and their consequences here. In simple language, it can be said that as you sow, so shall you reap, or as you plant, so shall you harvest. Good actions give rise to good desires, bad actions give rise to bad desires, and mixed actions give rise to mixed desires. However, the actions of yogis are nishkam, that is, performed without attachment, and therefore they are devoid of the tendencies of the senses and are not driven by desires. In yoga, the term 'vāsanā' is used to mean a tendency or a propensity of the mind that arises from the consequences of an action, or the residue of an action that affects a person and leads them to engage in a particular behavior."
4,9,"""Rishis had told earlier that the three types of actions and their fruits are reflected in the desires and impulses that arise in us. This led to a question on how it is possible for such precise consequences to arise from our actions. That is, how can it be that the action we perform will lead to a specific consequence, and then the same inclinations will arise in us? Rishis are answering this question by saying that when we perform some actions, we gradually develop a habit of doing those actions, and eventually, a tendency forms. This tendency is repeated many times, and the subtle impressions left on us become a part of our memory. Since memory is formed from impressions, there is no difference between memory and impressions. As our impressions become more solid, our memory also becomes stronger. Therefore, Rishis say that memory and impressions have a unity. When we are reborn according to the fruits of our past actions, our memory and impressions also accompanying us, even if there is a difference in our birth in terms of birthplace, location, or time. For example, if a being is born in a particular caste or species, it is still a part of the same species. Similarly, if a being is born in a particular place or time, its impression is not different. Therefore, Rishis say that as a result of our actions and impressions, our memory and impressions remain unbroken, whether we are reborn in a particular caste, place, or time."""
4,10,"""Sages say that due to the desire to live forever, which is inherent in every human being, the flow of desires has been going on since time immemorial. Every individual wants to live forever and never die. This desire is the root of all desires. They know that as long as life exists, they can experience and enjoy everything. Therefore, the desire to remain alive forever is the source of all desires and the foundation of all other desires. If this desire is not fulfilled, then gradually, other habits and tendencies will weaken. The sage is saying that the truth of the uninterrupted flow of desires is one thing, and the suggestion of a great means or method to be free from this eternal desire to live is another. If one abandons this desire and practices selfless action, it will lead to liberation. I will never die, but will always live on, because I am filled with this intense desire. Because in every birth, when death is near, the living being is filled with the fear of death and collects the powerful feeling of not wanting to die. The fear of death increases, and the desire to live forever also becomes very strong. This desire becomes the foundation of all other desires. Therefore, if one is freed from the fear of death, it will be easy to also free oneself from the influence of other desires. Man knows that as long as life exists, he can enjoy everything else. Therefore, he does not want to give up this desire to live forever."""
4,11,"Ancient sages said that our vasanas, which are the tendencies that arise from our actions, have been present since time immemorial. Now, the sage is explaining the method or process to get rid of these vasanas. They say that the four main causes of the existence of these vasanas are hetu, phala, ashraya, and alambana. Every action we do has a cause behind it, and when that action is performed, it has a definite result. This is the cause and effect of karma. When this karma is done, it becomes attached to our mind or inner self, and then it becomes a habit. When we encounter a situation or emotion, these past karma's impressions arise again, and we start to act according to them. The more we do this, the stronger they become. This is the reason why the sages call it alambana. So, it is essential to get rid of the causes, effects, and attachment to karma, and only then can we get rid of the vasanas. When a yogi performs an action, it no longer creates new karma's impressions, and he becomes detached from the world. In this way, the sage is establishing the method to be free from karma and its bondages and to establish oneself in selfless action."
4,12,"""The sage has said in the preceding verse that if the four main causes of desires are removed, then the flow of desires that has been going on since eternity can also cease to exist. Desires represent the impressions of our actions, which are related to our internal life. But what about the physical or worldly objects that exist in the world? If the main causes of those objects are removed, then do those objects also cease to exist? Someone asked such a question. In response to this question, the sage said this verse. He says that the basic nature or dharma of an object or thing is what is meant by the term 'dharma' in scriptural language. An object or thing is said to be dharma. That dharma or nature does not cease to exist with time. There is only a difference in that the dharma or nature that existed in the past does not manifest again, and the possibility of it manifesting again in the future remains. In the present, it remains expressed. For example, a potter is creating a pot from clay today, and it is manifesting in the present. However, it was not a pot earlier, only clay. This is the pot's past. The pot will not exist in the future, it will break. Then the clay will remain. However, the clay remains in both past and future times, and the potential to create another pot is present in it. Therefore, the sage is saying that any object exists eternally, not because of time, but because of its inherent nature or causes, and it does not get destroyed."""
4,13,"Now that Maharshi has clearly stated that any substance (neither past, nor future, nor present) does not perish, but exists in its own unique form, the disciples' curiosity arose as to how these substances exist. They wanted to know the form of their existence. So, to resolve this curiosity, this Sutra is being said. Maharshi says that all substances existing in the past, present, and future exist in their guna form. In the present, they exist in their expressed form, which is being stated here in the word, and in the past and future, they exist in an unexpressed form, which Maharshi is saying here in the subtle word. The Guna word here refers to Sat, Raj, and Tamas. Because all substances are a part of Nature, and Nature is triguna, all substances are created from these three gunas. These three gunas are present in all substances, and due to their varying proportions, substances undergo various changes or transformations. Therefore, substances are expressed in two ways, directly and indirectly, depending on their relation to time, but they do not perish, rather they preserve their existence in the form of the three gunas. Here, the question is not about the destruction or non-destruction of one substance, but about the existence of the substance in Nature. It should not be understood that we can destroy one substance and then somehow it will manifest again. First, the substance will exist in many places in Nature, and, fundamentally, it will already be present. Even if, hypothetically, the entire Nature is destroyed, is it possible for the substance to be reborn? In this form, Maharshi says that the three gunas - Sat, Raj, and Tamas - will always exist and are the fundamental cause of the origin of all substances, and as long as these causes are not destroyed or exhausted, the destruction of any substance is not possible. These gunas are capable of creating the substance again."
4,14,"""According to the ancient sages, the universe is not destroyed even by one moment of time, but rather it manifests and hides in its three aspects, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Now, since we are discussing the topic of gunas, it is clear that these gunas have opposing natures, and therefore, different actions and reactions manifest in objects. Sattva guna's function is illumination, Rajas guna's function is action, and Tamas guna's function is to maintain stability. Thus, when these opposing gunas come together, they simultaneously create something new, which becomes one entity. 

Like when we perform worship in a temple, we combine different things like flowers, offerings, oil, ghee, and fire, which are initially separate entities with their own names, and through their combination, we create a new entity, the flame. Although the flame is derived from its individual components, we no longer consider its five individual components, but rather the flame itself has become a new, independent entity. 

Similarly, when the three gunas combine to create a new entity, it becomes one, independent existence. In a philosophical sense, the three gunas are indeed separate, but when they combine to create an entity, that entity is not recognized as having its three separate aspects. 

The ancient sage has explained this in order for us to understand the practical reality of the world and recognize the underlying principles within it simultaneously."""
4,15,"When it becomes clear that the entity remains the same even after the result is achieved, then the question arises as to why everyone experiences the same entity differently. Why can't everyone have the same experience and description of that entity? Then, the sage replies that it is because of the different types of knowledge that exist in our minds, even though the entity remains the same. The same entity can be experienced differently by different people. For example, when we share a single orange among five people, each person may experience its sweetness and bitterness differently. Each person may describe the taste of the orange in a different way, although the orange remains the same, with the same sweetness and bitterness. Similarly, people may have different opinions about a single person, although that person remains the same. This diversity is due to the different types of knowledge that exist in our minds. Until our mind is affected by the gunas, we will see diversity. But when we acquire knowledge of the Self, then our experience becomes one and the same as the Self."
4,16,"""In the entire Yog Sutra, this is the only sutra where Maharshi Patanjali himself raises questions. They first establish the fundamental principles and say that the world or objects are not governed by a single mind. They clearly explain this and then ask, if the creator of an object's existence is a single mind, then what would happen if that mind ceases to exist? Would the object also cease to exist? But it's not seen that way. When the mind focuses on another object, the first object, which was present a moment ago, becomes invisible.

To say that the mind is the cause of creation, that's unscientific and impractical. Let's assume that our mind has perceived an eye and then a field through our sense of perception and they both have become reality. If we consider the mind as the creator of all objects, then the first eye should cease to exist. But the eye remains and is visible to others as well.

Therefore, those who believe the world to be illusory, fleeting, or a dream, are wrong. But it's true that the world is impermanent, ephemeral, a dream, from the perspective of the Self, and hence it's not a problem to strive for self-realization. However, not realizing that everything is illusory and fleeting and becoming detached, is wrong. Because nature has its own independent existence and its own extension. Objects come into existence due to their inherent principles, not due to the mind or some other cause. Even if we destroy a pot or a tree, we cannot destroy their constituent elements because nature's principles are indestructible.

Therefore, Maharshi is refuting many prevailing theories that consider the world to be a dream or an illusion and says that this world is our creation, a reflection of our imagination, like a dream that disappears after waking up. This analysis is entirely baseless from a physical perspective, but on the spiritual level, considering the world as impermanent and ephemeral, detachment is achieved. And that's the right path."""
4,17,"""After it is clear that substances are separate from the state of consciousness. They come into being as part of nature's own creation and then merge with it. There is no reason for the origin of a conscious being that is different from nature. When Maharshi asked what would happen to the existence of a thing or substance if consciousness were not present, a doubt arose as to what would happen if consciousness were not the creator of the origin of things or substances. Maharshi says that consciousness connects with our senses and provides knowledge of things to the conscious person. When consciousness connects with a thing through the medium of the eyes, an image of that thing is reflected in consciousness, making that thing known to consciousness. And whatever thing, person, or substance does not connect with consciousness through the medium of the eyes, whether due to any reason, remains unknown to consciousness. However, this is not to say that if consciousness does not connect with something through the eyes, then the existence of that thing, person, or substance does not exist. The matter is simply that the image of that thing, person, or substance does not form on consciousness, making it unknown to consciousness. In this verse, Maharshi is saying that consciousness comes to know of external substances through connection and does not come to know without connection."""
4,18,"""In this world, there are many physical objects, things, and individuals. Yet, from the perspective of space, everything is very far from each other. One individual cannot know everything about all physical objects, things, or individuals at the same time. Therefore, it is not possible for our minds to establish a connection with all things at once and gain knowledge through sensory organs. Therefore, we can know only about the objects, substances, or individuals that appear before us at a given moment. The rest remains unknown to us. Similarly, our minds can know only what we have learned or experienced through sensory organs or through the reflection of past experiences in our minds. But the Self, which is consciousness, has knowledge of everything at all times. It is unaffected by time and does not undergo any change. Therefore, it gains knowledge of everything through no other means than itself. The implication is that knowledge is always present in the Self, and its expression requires the means of perception, such as senses, etc. If these means are pure, knowledge can be expressed at any time. However, even when knowledge is expressed through means such as memory, etc., it is still the Self that has that knowledge."""
4,19,"""In the previous sutra, it was said that the conscious entity (purush) knows all the modifications of the mind (chitta). Why, then, does the mind not know its own perceptions (vritti) of objects? Maharshi is explaining this point. The mind is constructed from the fundamental elements of nature, and anything that is constructed from these fundamental elements is called an insentient substance (jada dravya). This concept should be remembered by us. All the properties of insentient substances are controlled by nature. Insentient substances cannot do anything on their own. They can only function when consciousness is in contact with them. Similarly, all insentient substances exist for the sake of the individual's sense enjoyment and liberation (mukti), but not for their own sake. These are some fundamental principles of these insentient substances that we should bear in mind in order to determine the truth.

The mind also experiences the light of the Self only when it comes into contact with it through sensory organs and bonds with objects in the world, experiencing knowledge of the Self. Maharshi is saying that the reason the mind is not self-aware is that it is obscured by its own perceptions. The understanding of this is that the mind is like the moon, which appears to shine with its own light but is actually shining with the light of the sun. Similarly, the mind appears to think and perceive with its own light but is actually contemplating the Self through the light of consciousness. When the mind comes into contact with the Self, it shines and, through its contact with sensory organs, experiences the knowledge of the objects of the world."""
4,20,"""The thread of thought and this 20th sutra are intertwined. The earlier sutra says that the mind cannot know itself because it is illuminated by the Self, not from within. Now, along with this, I am saying that the mind cannot even know both itself and the object together. Due to the mind's being an earthly body, we have discussed all possible theories in the earlier sutra. Here, Maharsi is establishing the importance of a conscious entity over the mind. Because if we consider the mind to be the one that knows things, then we cannot reach the ultimate truth. Here, Maharsi is trying to show how the existence of a conscious entity over the mind is necessary through these two sutras. Nature does not have self-knowledge, and even objects created by nature do not have self-knowledge. Only the Purusha or conscious entity can know both itself and nature. The reason for this is the characteristic of the conscious principle not changing with time. If you are 40 years old today, you can still recall events from your childhood. The reason for this is that the conscious principle within does not change. The experience of an event in childhood is still present in one's memory today. Therefore, Maharsi is establishing a conscious entity over the mind and saying that we should connect our existence to the conscious principle of the Self, not to some other earthly substance like the mind, intellect, or consciousness. Because most people identify themselves with the mind or intellect, which is a great ignorance."""
4,21,"""The rishis are explaining the role and function of the mind from different perspectives. When Patanjali was writing the Yoga Sutras, he was attempting to understand the mind as the observer. A section of society did not accept the existence of consciousness beyond the mind, so the rishis are discussing the true nature of the mind from various angles to establish a correct understanding of consciousness. They ask, if one mind observes another mind, then what kind of knowledge can the observer have? It would be impossible to determine, as the mind would keep changing and the sequence would not stop. This would lead to confusion and the creation of a state that is neither proper nor achievable. Moreover, if knowledge is gained, it would be fleeting, and how would memory remain? Many would gain knowledge of the same thing, but it would be difficult to obtain true knowledge of it. Which one person would gain knowledge of something? There would be many questions and flaws in this theory, so it is not reasonable or possible to accept that one mind can have knowledge of another. Therefore, the rishis are discussing the existence of consciousness beyond the mind, considering all possibilities."""
4,22,"""Now Maharishi is establishing the clear doctrine that the soul is free from all types of actions and attachment, and when it gets associated with a thought that has caught the mind, it experiences either the knowledge of its own wisdom or the knowledge of its own intellect. Maharishi believes that the soul neither becomes one with the object nor changes with the knowledge of the object. It is our mind, intellect, and senses that change with the object, but due to its unchanging nature, the soul remains unaltered and unaffected. Just as a diamond, when a colored object is placed before it, appears to change color, but its intrinsic color remains constant and pure. As soon as the object is removed, the diamond returns to its original state. Similarly, the soul also acquires knowledge of its own intellect as soon as it comes into contact with the mind. When a seeker is in a state of meditation and not associated with the mind in any way, the soul experiences itself. There, the need for the assistance of the body does not arise. This doctrine is being established by Maharishi here."""

In this way, it is colored by both the subjects and the soul. When it is associated with external subjects, it appears unconscious, and when it comes into contact with the soul, it appears conscious. The mind can be considered like a mirror. Just as the mirror becomes clearer with increasing clarity, the reflection in it becomes clearer and more evident. When the reflections of external objects through the senses fall on the mind, the soul, being in contact with the mind, gains knowledge of the reflections on the mind. Similarly, when the reflection of the soul's nature falls on the mind, the soul gains knowledge of its own nature. In other words, whether it is a matter of gaining knowledge of the external world or experiencing one's own self, a pure and clear mind is necessary. Therefore, the mind is like a mirror. The mind-mirror has its own form, but as the reflection takes shape before it, so the knowledge is imparted to the soul."""

Despite being tainted by various types of actions, senses, and desires, the mind cannot use them for its own benefit. Its entire purpose is for the atma. The guru explains that the mind's nature is to work together with other components, just like how various parts of a computer come together to form a computer that is used by humans. The mind's purpose is to take on this form and then be used by the individual.

As one walks on the path of yoga, and simultaneously, the impressions of practices from previous births also arise, the yogi's desire or curiosity to know about themselves gradually diminishes. Initially, when one begins to progress on the path of self-realization, a seeker has many questions about themselves, which they want to find the answers to. As they study scriptures along with their yoga practice, their questions are gradually answered and resolved. When they attain the final wisdom, they are free from questions. Because they have acquired eternal knowledge about themselves, they are established only in conduct. They know what to do, how to attain completeness on the path of conduct, and they continue to practice only that. Therefore, Maharishi says that if one attains wisdom, the yogi transcends all questions that arise about themselves, and instead, they strengthen their yoga practice, the conduct of realization, from the point of view of resolution."""

But after achieving self-realization, they take shelter behind self-realization and move forward, which leads to culmination. The yogi also begins to experience the bliss of it. The philosophical meaning of self-realization is the correct knowledge of right and wrong. From the perspective of human life, human ultimate goal is liberation, from the perspective of the human being, reunion with the self and the supreme self, knowing what is suitable and what is not suitable for the self, self-realization is called. When this knowledge comes to the yogi and their state is established in this knowledge, they become completely fearless and free, taking shelter behind self-realization, and move towards culmination. At that time, they experience simplicity and straightforwardness, moving forward gradually. That is the state where all afflictions born of ignorance become extremely weak and there is no internal turmoil left in their life, and their state becomes natural."

In the present, when the yogi is attached to the previous lives' experiences and the current life's practices through yoga, he reaches the point where the principles of self-knowledge shine forth. The knowledge of self-knowledge apart from the knowledge of previous lives' experiences that arises later is due to the influence of old habits. Although all the troubles caused by ignorance are very weak, they do not cease entirely. Therefore, the yogi's state is sometimes complete and perfect, and sometimes wavering due to the influence of old habits. In this state, the yogi should not be disturbed and should stand firm like a witness, unaffected by the influence of old habits. Old habits will come and exhibit their effects, and then go. We should not get entangled with them. Those old habits that come forth will be completely resolved, and for that, a separate effort will be required.

4,28,"""In the previous sutra, it was mentioned that the accumulation of past births' habits comes between the realms of wisdom. Now, Maharsi is explaining the means to eliminate those habits in this sutra. Maharsi is talking about the practice of Kriya Yoga again to eliminate these past habits. Just as in Siddha Pada, ignorance, ego, attachment, hatred, and desire were eliminated initially and then completely, similarly, these remaining habits can be eliminated only through Kriya Yoga. The meaning of Kriya Yoga is tapasya, self-reflection, and surrender to the Divine. We have elaborated on this in Siddha Pada. Through Kriya Yoga, these habits are weakened, and through repeated practice of Kriya Yoga and the practice of wisdom, all these habits are burned, so they cannot sprout again. Therefore, the yogi who has reached the state of Kaivalya must make utmost effort to restrain all their habits in the final stage. When the mind is directed towards the fulfillment of its purpose, and the entire nature is returning to its true form, the three gunas - sattva, rajas, and tamas - make their final attempt to remain in their respective states. Thus, this is the final battle that the yogi must fight with all their might.

VivekKhyaati ji says that in this state, the yogi becomes detached from all worldly pleasures and amenities, to the extent that he even gives up all the powers he has achieved through his yogic practices. In other words, he maintains no attachment to anything of this world. His sole desire is to attain the state of kaivalya, which is his natural and simple, pure form. This state is what Maharshi Dharmamegha refers to as samadhi, where the stream of kaivalya knowledge flows unbroken and unrestricted by any desires. Just as a cloud takes the shape of a river and flows, in a similar manner, the true dharma within the yogi begins to flow. This is the highest state of suprajnatha samadhi."

In the same way, the outcome of Dharmamegh self-realization is the destruction of leftover sorrows from past lives. After Dharmamegh self-realization, all sorrows, whether from this life or many past lives, are completely eliminated and the yoga practitioner's life becomes oriented towards the ultimate goal of Kaivalya. At this point, there is no place for sorrows (ignorance, ego, attachment, aversion, and identity) and neither is there any impediment in yoga. The yoga practitioner's life becomes completely attribute-less, where all complex and uncomplicated thoughts cease to affect his life.

4,31,"When a yogi attains the highest state of samadhi, the ultimate state of self-realization, then all sorrow, pain, and other negative emotions cease to exist. All impurities and coverings that obscure the yogi's knowledge are also eliminated, and the yogi is flooded with infinite knowledge. This knowledge is so boundless that there is little left to discover in the entire existence.

If one truly understands this concept, then the essence of yoga philosophy becomes clear. As long as we lead a ordinary life, we are not living the life of a yogi. Many coverings and impurities obscure our minds, and we are surrounded by numerous external and internal impurities. Our lives are filled with pain, desires, and sorrows.

Our senses perceive everything through the medium of the mind, and as a result, our minds become polluted with various impressions. As a result, we become prone to grief, despair, hopelessness, and helplessness. According to scripture, the union of nature and the individual soul is the root cause of all suffering. This union is referred to as the ""mal"" or impurity.

The ability to transcend these coverings, pain, desires, and impurities is what is referred to as yoga sadhana. This is the problem-ridden and solution-filled gap between two lives. To fill this gap, one must understand the problem correctly and start the journey of finding the solution. Maharshi has said that the attainment of infinite knowledge and the knowledge-worthy is scarce. This can be interpreted in two ways.

First, the yogi attains infinite knowledge and has little to learn from the external world. In this sense, the yogi becomes all-knowing.

Second, the yogi is capable of understanding the infinite and has little need to know anything else, for once one has realized oneself and the ultimate reality, knowing or not knowing external things becomes irrelevant. The latter interpretation is more justified, for the soul is not all-knowing, and only the ultimate reality is all-knowing. Therefore, anything beyond the soul's knowledge is limited. This interpretation appears to be correct."

When a yogi is placed in the state of Dharmamegh Samadhi, these three gunas perform their actions. Therefore, there is no movement or deviation in these gunas. Since there is no movement or deviation, no further action is created. The sequence and result of the three gunas come to an end. When one of the gunas emerges or one guna becomes subdued, a sequence begins. Maharshi is explaining this sequence, and as the sequence unfolds, the result changes. Maharshi will explain the sequence and result of the three gunas separately in the next verse. Here, Maharshi is speaking about the end of the sequence and result of the three gunas.

For example, a newborn's body, mind, intellect, and heart undergo changes every moment, but we are not aware of it every moment. We gain awareness of this change only after six months or a year when the child starts walking and talking. This sutra was explained here with the intention of understanding the sequence and result mentioned earlier. As we are now moving towards the completeness of yoga, we should also resolve all doubts and questions. The transformation of three gunas is an outcome of their cooperation and the expectation of time. Therefore, the author of this sutra has resolved the last doubt in the sequence of yoga sutras."""
4,34,"Let us discuss the final verse of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, verse 4.34, which is about the ultimate goal of human life, Moksha or Kaivalya. Human life is a journey of four Purusharthas - Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha. While Dharm and Moksha are the ultimate goals, most people's lives are stuck in between, driven by desires and material pursuits. A yogi, through his spiritual practices, can transcend these limitations and attain Moksha or Kaivalya.

The three main functions of the three gunas - Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas - are to provide comfort, create attachment, and lead to forgetfulness, respectively. When these gunas are transcended, the individual self is liberated, and there is no further rebirth.

In this state of Kaivalya, the individual self experiences its true nature, free from attachments and desires. From this state, the individual self, free from all worldly desires, experiences the ultimate bliss of Self-Realization."
